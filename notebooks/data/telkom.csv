I received a contact number of Piet Sherende at the Key West branch in Krugersdorp from my sister (they had a big issue with their home service a few months back and he was the only one able to assist them in a timely, friendly manner).

I proceeded to make contact with him and he immediately was able to tell me what documents he needed from me, he sent me the forms, and kept me posted on all progress.
Now, my line is finally canceled and I can only thank Piet for this.

He really went above and beyond with his service for me (and my sister), and he really was one of the most knowledgeable, friendly, and considerate employees of Telkom (or any large company for the matter!) I have ever had the pleasure of dealing with.

I have ordered a Samsung cellphone and sim contract on the 26th of Nov from Telkom via a supervisor after being already escalated via the call center because of receiving poor service. 

I have been advised that the application was successful and processed and that Telkom does not send any proof of your order via email or message. 

I found that quite strange but was advised that I must simply trust that the order will be correct, where after I was assured that this will be delivered to my home address within the next 3-5 working days. 

However, this was not the case. I received a message on the delivery of my order on Wednesday, 7th Dec but did not receive this and after contacting the courier service I finally got my parcel today, the 9th of Dec just to get the biggest surprise of all… a sim card BUT NO SAMSUNG!!

This is an absolute disgrace and the worst service I have ever experienced. This while being an existing Telkom client. I am extremely unhappy and will NEVER recommend Telkom again.

How best can we address this issue?

The  is the network is so poor such that I cant even make a call from my house, let alone the inability to use my mobile data. I solely rely in wifi to make whatsapp calls and when its off it means no calls for me. I need to drive up Parklands Main Road to Caltex Garage to be able to make a clear call.

This problem is common for me on Telkom and even MTN since my wife uses MTN.

I am on Andriod and I also have iOS.

I use Samsung A50 for Telkom Mobile, and iPhone 12 for MTN. This is not a devuce problem, it is a poor network issue in Parklands East, Surrey Street and Brompton Bend.

I am a very loyal customer and I  can say that not all months are the same for people financially wise. I only skipped the month of October by not making payments with Telkom, I obviously knew that I was going to be debited twice by the end of November. I was debited an amount of R2456.66 on the 28th of November 2022. I recently received my Telkom invoice showing that I owe Telkom an amount of R3921.01. I was shocked. I called in and enquired and the consultant had told me that the money with take up to 7 - 14 working days to reflect in the collections department. My question is ""How?"" because for a network provider that is as huge as Telkom normally recieves payments from their consumers and the amounts take approximately 24 - 48 hours to reflect so how come is there so much of a delay for payments to reflect and why do they have to take 7 days to reflect??
I had told the consultant to get this matter fixed as there is no way I will be paying R3900 hence I has requested for a proper invoice once the matter is fixed, she told me that she can not do that as the invoices are automatically generated I just need to wait for my January 2023 invoice. Imagine the incompetence!! My question is why do I have to wait for January's statement to see that the matter is resolved? Why can't they resolve it now and give me a proper billing invoice - I do not have enough assurance that can show that by the end of December 2022 I'll be debited my normal balance.

Please note that it has been more than a week and still no feedback??

No updates on where the application is at all

I went on the telkom website early as soon as the deals were released and tried to do the application but the application keeps loopoling back to the beginning without success then a friendly gentleman called me to complete the application later that day on the 25th, which he says was approved then received this reference number Your Online application quote reference:**********

I keep getting emails saying that my order is still in my basket and I should proceed... I called in twice and 2 staff say it was approved... One lady says there might not even be stock which is ridiculous as I did the application on the black Friday and the special was still running way after 
This is meant to be a birthday gift for my son next week and I am still sitting in limbo on where or when or will receive the tablet

I have been a loyal client of telkom for years and have no other service provider but 
Do I need to forget this application and rather go buy something in another store??

This was my first time taking a black Friday deal and my first time coming to this branch. If I could give it -5 starts I would! 
I went there on the 24th of November and was told by the consultant that there was no stock but I should sign the contract and the phone would be arriving the next day around 9am and she will give me a call the next day when it arrives. 
I waited all of Friday and did not receive any form of communication from Sharnray as promised (that was the consultant I dealt with). I called the number I found online but that was for the other branch in pavilion and the lady I spoke to told me they had received their stock so the other branch should have received theirs as well. 
On Saturday I drove all the way there and waited for about 30 Min only to be told they still don't have stock of the phones and they will call me. The consultant I dealt with was not at work that day. I waited a few more days and went back exactly a week after signing the contract and once again the consultant was not there. I spoke to the same lady that assisted me on Saturday and she said they still don't have stock of the phone.

My issue is how can Telkom advertise for a deal/contract when they have no stock? The consultants can't even give me a ETA on when they will get their stock. 

I emailed Sharnray as she had deceived me by promising me the phones would arrive the next day, a whole week and 2 days later I didn't even receive a courtesy call from her to tell me they still haven't received stock of the phones. I made 3 trips to pavilion and I live a distance away (and let's face it, fuel is expensive), all because the consultants are so greedy for the sale but can't even keep up good customer service to keep you informed. 
The consultants response is she told me she will call me and she will. 

I would never come back to this branch as the consultants are rude and arrogant. She was friendly when making the sale but now when I'm questioning when I will get my phone, she is rude. I am going to be billed for the new contract next month and don't even have the devices and she cannot even tell me if it will be weeks or months till I get it. 

Never shop on black Friday at Telkom and don't waste your time with the branch at Pavilion because you will only be disappointed with the after sale service. They're not helpful. They can't even pick up the phone and call you to apologize for the delay and that they haven't forgotten you.",Telkom,telkom,telkom-pavilion-consultants-lack-customer-care-and-are-rude-4209676,0,[],https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/hp-cdn-01/uploads/orgs/org_793962_logo_hPUx0SvDxJ768HorIPr8.png,/static/img/industries/icons/telecommunications-icon.jpg,Telecommunications,telecommunications,1,,WEBSITE,False,,2018-12-01,3,[]

My account went into arrears for the first time and I went to the store to correct it and make payment via pep stores, I did this because of the 10 day window and was told that it would be debited on the 7th and it was not. I continued not having service for an entire month and was debited on the 25 November, it is now the 01 December and I have made numerous calls to have my service reinstated, and no agent was able to assist me, they either keep quite when I ask them for assistance or hang up on me.

On my 3rd call since this issue began I called in and told the agent to change my debit order date to the 05th the idiot goes and changes it to the 05th of December, knowing full well that payment has been debited for the month of October and November already, he changes it to the 05 December, yet the next payment would be due only on the 05 January 2023.

Over and above that, Telkom charges me for services that I have not even used since my line was suspended in October and the unprofessional call Centre agents do not know why my bill for December reflects an amount over the monthly contract fee

This kind of service from Telkom is pathetic, unprofessional and they have no sense of customer centricity at both store level and call Centre. It is disappointing to go through such stupidity from people who were suppose to assist a customer with their account.

I would never reccomed Telkom and it's shoddy, unprofessional service to anyone as it is a nightmare when it comes to query resolution and their staff really let's down their brand.

She confirmed it would take up to 36 hours to correct this and I asked how I log a formal complaint she said I need to email her on her work email address to log the complaint.

I loved the formal complaint and no feedback was provided, not even acknowledgment of the complaint.

The manger can Only call me knowing damn well my line is suspended and I can't receive calls. 
They could not give me a time scale of when I would get this call and after stating I would like an email instead because my service is blocked the second agents said "" my manager will email you""
I asked for the manager's name and she dropped the line.  How can you not provide me with a first name but when he emails me I'd have his full name. 

I sent two additional emails to the complaint team and no feedback was provided on this either.

My name is 339 167 592 and my spouse is known as 336 722 073. I guess you will recognise us easier by our account numbers, as Telkom demonstrated in the last year that we are only contracts with no rights and without any proper channel for recourse.
I know, as revealed by a historical lack of response, that my email will fall yet again on deaf ears. However, I remain the eternal optimist believing the next Telkom employee that reads my mail will realise the importance of holding on to existing customers.
This horror story that I am going to share with you starts exactly 12 months ago, to the day. 
I have been a contractholder with Telkom for the good part of 5 years. My spouse has been with Telkom at least 12 years.
We have a landline ADSL account under my spouse' name.
I personally have three contracts:
1. ********** (personal phone)
2. ********** (mediapad)
3. ********** (personal phone - spouse)
and then, our landline ADSL:
1. **********

This email contains various complaints. I will take it one at a time to separate the issues.

COMPLAINT 1 - LANDLINE ADSL
In the last year, we have had numerous problems with our internet at home.  Our main grumble nonetheless as follows:
In September 2022, our neighbour across the road had a tree that fell over and with it, it took the line down that was attached to the pole. This uprooted the pole across the road  and the pole that is next to our driveway. The OneServe technician came and did a temporary fix because I need the internet as I work from home.
He reported that the poles and a new mainline must be replaced. This was already done on the 13th of September. Today's date is 30th November 2022. Nothing has been done. Our internet is down yet again (ref no. 76BNR301122)
We pay our account on time, every month for 12 years and this is the service we receive? Thank you Telkom for treating us unjust and showing us that we are mere numbers.

COMPLAINT 2 - MEDIAPAD ORDER 
I placed the order (contract renewal) on 30th November 2021. After 5 months of constant calls, 43 emails, running up and down to your stores (both Shelly Centre and Oribi Plaza) I received the madiapad in April 2022. For the WHOLE PERIOD, I paid for an instrument I didn't even have in hand to use. Thank you Telkom for treating us unjust and demonstrating we are mere numbers.

COMPLAINT 3 - LINES DISCONNECTED WITH NO REASON.
We make use of two banks to pay our Telkom accounts.
FNB for the landline ADSL, and Standard Bank for the 3 instruments on contract.
The FNB debit order has a maximum of R600 while the Standard Bank debit doesn't have a cap.
Whenever the amount owed exceeds R600, I pay the difference via EasyPAy at Pick n Pay. 
In September, I presented the bills to the cashier at Pick n Pay and she took the R149.00 owed. This transaction went through. When I received the new Telkom Invoice (Landline ADSL) I saw that the amount was not deducted. I phoned Telkom (10210) and reported this. In November (after constant calls and emails sending the proof of payment) I received an email from one Jacqui Fourie. She informed me that the funds were allocated to my contract account (339 167 592) and not on the landline ADSL (336 722 073).
I explained that a mistake was made and that those funds should be allocated to our landline ADSL.
She transferred the funds but NEVER told me it will lead to a disconnection of my contract instruments.
I have a contract and landline ADSL for R1600 per month which is paid ON TIME, EVERY MONTH, but Telkom thought it good to disconnect our contract instruments for a mere R149.00
I have paid for the mediapad for 5 months without even having it. We have paid our accounts for 12 years, EVERY MONTH ON TIME. We have been waiting for a proper and permanent Internet connection for more than 60 days and yet still, Telkom has NO SHAME to disconnect our intruments for a mere R149.00 through a mistake that was not even ours.

If this unfortunate episode leads to a negative impression on my credit report, I will, without hesitation, instruct my lawyer to litigate this matter.

I will also, never ever again renew a contract with Telkom. I am also researching Fibre options to distance myself and my family from any service (or lack thereof) provided by Telkom.

I have no faith that this email will rectify any of my complaints. At least I will have a paper trail of the very bad service I have received.

Disappointed

So my problem is, our fibre line that we so graciously pay Telkom R699 every month seems to lost wih regards to connection. 

This is how it is explained to us when we have to phone in every single time our fibre line says "" Connected - no internet connection""

Not like telkom will compensate me for the couple of hundreds i spent on airtime to phone them only to be told same process over and over again...but that every time i call in it doesnt raise a flag for anybody to advise or think, hey maybe there is something really wrong. 

We.get told, restart the router, go to 10.0.0.2 gateway, set up and redo everything there, last resort was if you know your load shedding schedule, switch the router off before load shedding, that way it wont reconfigure itself. 

Now im no boffin in this, but this tells me is a problem when your router reconfigures itself or resets itself EVERYTIME AFTER LOAD SHEDDING...does this even make sense, like 1+1=11 here, really..

Buy wait best part is, we get told, when load shedding comes back on and we switch router on, wait for it, IT MUST FIND ITSELF IN THE CONNECTION PROCESS...like really...like alice in wonderland here...


So now why i have resorted to hello peter cause telkom route is not a way as it failed us. 

Yet they quick to take debit order, but SLOW to assist in one's problem.

So my query, at Telkoms cost, will someone be so kind to assist to identify why we cant immediately get connected. 

Today, 30nov2022, loadshedding was 4pm to 6pm, we put router off before 4pm, put it back on after power came back on, it is now 8:10pm, and still its busy finding itself..

I am so close to cursing, but it truly is ridiculous....paying 699 fir what, for our router/internet/fibre to have a mental issue in finding itself. 

So please help..really... frustration is not even how I want to describe how i am feeling.....


I sincerely hope SOMEONE responds with a better outcome....

First, she told me I was declined for that deal due to a credit check, but that I could get a different deal with just 1 phone. I told her I would go in-store and do the application that way. She then asked me to provide my details again and all of a sudden I was approved for the double deal.

She took me through the whole application process and read the terms and conditions etc. I was told to accept the debicheck which I did do. I was told that the phones would be delivered in 5-7 business days. I had to provide an OTP which also had a reference number of **********.

Today I called to follow up as I have not received the phones or a contract. The first consultant I got through to was very rude and ended the call while I was speaking. I then called back and spoke to a consultant by the name of Sizophila who was very helpful and explained that my application was declined. 

Now my issue is this. How was I told that it was approved and that I would be getting the phones in 5-7 days? If it was declined, why was I not contacted and told this?

I have been waiting for the phones and even bought covers and screen guards for both phones which I now have to return

I need Telkom to assist me with regards to my fiber connection that was cut off. 
I called, I went to the branch but no one seems to assist.
I currently have a contract with Telkom which happened to have been cut off bcoz they claim I have not paid for the the entire year. 
That  Suprised me bcoz every month Telkom deducts whats due to them. 
I had my broadband data contract, I was told it will be canceled once Fibre is connected.
The contract I signed and sent to Telkom gives all my information, address including my banking details. 
Question is 
1.why did they not process the contract.
2. How does a person use fiber connection for a year and they only realise that I have not been paying after year. 
3.i gave my details why didn't Telkom deduct the amount due to them. 
Why should I suffer for their incompetence.
4. Why did they disconnect my Fibre hence it is not my fault. 
5. Monthly there were deductions up until today, in my thought I was sure its for the Fibre connection since I was assured that my broadband  would be changed to fibre connection. 
6.i went twice to Telkom offices, they lodged a appeal, but seems like the status remains the same.
7. Calls were made, and somehow the client struggled to hear me
8. I appeal that the Telkom cancel all the claim I owe them. Its sickly and I am mad because I'm stuck I cannot carry on with anything if in their books they claim that I owe them. 
9.Telkom should with immediate effect cancell or take off Auto subscriptions. 
10. I also strongly dispute the R1903
I am sick and tired of Telkom. I cannot trust them anymore. I rather go somewhere else where I will get better service. 
Failing which, I will include my lawyers to intervene in this regard. I am tired of Telkom.

When I was at the store on the Monday he told me that they required stock of the phone I wanted - I agreed to wait but did ask him that he keep me updated - I then phoned on the Tuesday and apparently he hadn't even done the IBT as it seems in that store if they have load shedding for 2 hours it actually mean's to the staff that they have a whole day of not being able to work on their system. I again called on the Thursday as no one comes back to a person only to find out that Zulu was not working that day - I then had to find another number to call - I spoke to a lady that worked at the shop and she said she would see if she could help me - also never came back to me - I again called on the Thursday - only to be told that they have to do a credit check now - as I seem to have 3 lines - and in saying that - I wanted to do an upgrade - NOT A NEW CONTRACT but I asked her to assist me and to find out if there was anything else I could do to assist - while speaking to me she started speaking to another person in the store in a language i could not understand and all she said is she would call me back - that was the Thursday 17 Nov. Needless to say she never called me back - on Monday 21st November - I once again called Zulu and asked to know what was going on - he again was not in the store and said he would call me back when he was in the store - this was at 11h46 - And once again, I called him at 15h00 the same day only for him to very quickly tell me he couldn't do anything coz they had load shedding - which I might add only started at 15h00 - so from the time i called him that morning until that afternoon - he was apparently not in the store at all ... I asked him again to please enquire about my upgrade at load shedding finished at 17h00 and they only closed at 18h00 - he promised me he would call me ... I am yet to receive that all. So for obvious reason's you can see that the ""customer service experience"" in that store does not happen at all - they don't call customer back - when i was in the store on that monday - 3 of the employee's were standing behind the counter dancing ... that is while customers are in the store - makes you wonder what they do when there is no customers ,... maybe why a person gets no help or feedback on the status of their upgrade. This morning I tried to call the store 4 times - all my calls were ignored - hence I eventually called the call centre and they assisted me with my upgrade.

I was in the 23rd month of my current contract and was told instead of upgrading they would give me a new contract and would port my current number onto the new sim card. On the 21st of October I emailed the branch to let them know that the change had not yet happened, to date no response to my email. I have been into the shop several times since then and also been in contact with 2 of the branch staff via WhatsApp. One month and 3 days later, I still don't have my own number. I cannot log into any of my banking for more than a month as the OTP's are all linked to the number I held before this mess up. My business is linked to the number, my children have memorised the number, it's my emergency number for everything should something happen to a family member.

Highly frustrated,1,"I have been dealing with ongoing billing issues for several months now and I have to say I am extremely frustrated and disappointed with the service I have been receiving.

During the end of May I tried to relocate my fibre line to my new location and upon speaking to one of the telkom consultants I was told a relocation order cannot be placed due to the system already showing that it was done. Hence they suggested I cancel my fibre line and apply for a new fibre line. I did exactly that and trusted that they would have cancelled my older fibre line.

After a month of relocating when I received my bill I noticed that there are 2 fibre networks that I have to pay for while I am only using the newly installed network. I contacted billing once again and they said they would cancel it for me, again I put my trust in the consultant and hoped it would have been cancelled. Now this has been an ongoing issue up until now. My previous one had only been cancelled in September and I have been extra all this time.

I was told that the correct changes should reflect on my bill come October and I would not have to pay for October, November and December which means I would have been refunded for all the months I have been paying extra. My bill is still extremely high and I am highly disappointed with the service I am receiving. I am only using the latest fibre connection from the start of June and have been paying excessive amounts up until now.

Wednesday they suspend my line without prior warning whilst I am still trying to sort out my billing which is extremely UNFAIR. I call the technical team and they inform me that it had been suspended due to an amount R1.20 outstanding which outrageous. Thursday I call billing and they inform me I owe another R920 and once that is paid my line should be restored. I made the payment on Thursday and now when I see today my line is still suspended and apparently payment has not reflected on their end. I was told to wait till Monday for this to be resolved.

I have been sorting out billing issues since the start of June up until now, and to add on they suspend the line without prior knowledge. I am seeing ridiculous amounts on my bill each time and I still get no clear answers as to why such was done. I am really disappointed with the service telkom and their consultants have been providing me with. I use to be a loyal telkom customer but after this experience i would not recommend telkom to anyone.",Telkom,telkom,telkom-billing-issues-not-resolved-till-now-highly-frustrated-4186137,0,[],https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/hp-cdn-01/uploads/orgs/org_793962_logo_hPUx0SvDxJ768HorIPr8.png,/static/img/industries/icons/telecommunications-icon.jpg,Telecommunications,telecommunications,1,,WEBSITE,False,,2022-11-18,1,[]

Telkom is working with scammers to steal my money, I have two data contracts with them. In October I noticed a slightly higher bill than normal and I contacted their call center and the feedback I got was, there are subscriptions running on my account which does not make sense to me because the routers I have don't have any screen or buttons I can use to subscribe to anything, so clearly Telkom or scammers subscribed on my behalf. The consultant cancelled the subscriptions in October 

Yesterday when my wife was checking the accounts, the subscriptions are still going off at R3 a day. Mind you all this money is debited together with the normal debit I signed up for, so the money is going directly to Telkom and I don't know if they share it with the scammers or they keep it to themselves.

I contacted Telkom in July to add my new bank account and since adding the new bank account it has only been issues. On the call, I was advised that my bank account will not be debited in for the bill on 25th July and I have to make a manual payment. On 22 July I made the manual payment to Telkom and the following Monday 25 July my account was debited with the amount owed (R3926). I immediately called Telkom and they advised that I reverse the debit order which I did.  For the following month of August, all went well and my bank account was debited as it should have been. 

From September onwards it has only been issues with them. The bill for September was R3944.51 and was never once debited from my account. My service was interrupted in mid-October and I could not use my number for any outgoing calls or use the data. I was in arrears for two months now and the bill for 25 October was R8248.48, however, this amount was never deducted from my account on 25 October. An amount of R5361.51 was rather deducted from my bank account even though R8248.48 was available in my bank account. 

On 3 November my service was reinstated. I then received a message on 12 November that my service will be suspended as I am nearing my credit limit.  I then called Telkom to ask if I can have the arrears split over two months for November and December 2022 and they flat out refused, knowing this isn't my problem and that they aren't taking debits from my account and each time they do not complete the debit orders it costs me an additional R202. I was advised I would have to pay 40% of the amount owed for this month now immediately to have my service reinstated (which I do not have as I made an agreement with them for 25th) and the 60% difference will be debited on 25 November. 

My service is currently suspended due to the arrears, however, this is not my fault as they aren't debiting when they are supposed to. I want service reinstated and the arrears bill to be split over two months and their incompetence is affecting my affordability.

I have noticed for quite some time that my Other network calls minutes are depleting quickly. I decided to visit the Telkom Eastgate Branch where I bought the phones to enquire. It was established that indeed Telkom is ripping me off. For example instead of 150 minutes for Other network calls, they have been giving me 50 minutes. So what else have you been ripping me off on and for how long?

I therefore request that Telkom email me my Statements for the two Contract Phones from the commencement of the contracts. I would further request Telkom to confirm what they have been supplying me throughout.

The line was an open line and I was advised to change spend limit to R1 so that I don't pay more than what the contract stated, I then reduced spending limit on 25/08 to R1. When my bill came through in Sept I was billed the normal R869, in Oct my bill increased to R969 & when I queried this I was told it was for data usage and I'm liable to pay, it didn't make sense because once my data is depleted I'm unable to connect to the internet and I the connect to my router. Now in Nov my bill says I need to pay R969 again and upon query this I am told it's for data usage, which I'm not aware of as my contract includes 3gigs and once that is used up I connect to my router. No one has been able to give me clarity as to why I'm being charged this extra R100 when I don’t use more than what I've got. Consultant I spoke to said the spending limit was only adjusted 24 October when I called in to Telkom, this is absolutely nonsense because when I contacted them on 24 /10 it was to query my invoice, I need the call recordings to be retrieved because it is apparent that there is some dishonesty happening. I have been billed incorrectly for past 2 months by Telkom for data usage I do not know. I’m currently on the Out Of Bundle option where if data has been depleted it stops internet access and I have connect to my wifi therefore I do not know why they have been charging me R100 every month for data. My contract includes a 3 gig data and minutes.

I advised that l will not be able to pay for services that I'm not getting as I'm not getting any assistance from Telkom to sort out my issue.

I am utterly disappointed and disgusted by the level of service I have been receiving from TelkomSa over the past twelve months or so. 

I have been using Telkom Mobile since 2014 when I ported my number from another network provider. I've never had a problem with the number until last year. 

Every second month my account gets locked or suspended. I've never been provided with a meaningful reason for this.  I have been told at times that it a fraud issue. Sometime I am told that it a Rica issue and that I need to send my Rica documents, and I comply. 

Each and every single time I call I get a different agent who want me to explain the issue all over again. When I call to follow up on a previous call I don't get any feedback but instead the call is treated like it is the first time I'm calling. Some agents are rude. They have no respect and will put little to no effort into getting the issue resolve.  The ratings at the end of the call are useless. 

I've also been going to two Telkom stores to try to get the issue resolved whenever Telkom decides to lock my account. I must say the agents at the store are always eager to help but they fail. It may be because they lack proper training or they are not provided with enough resources or tools. That is why I always end up calling 180.

My number has been locked since Thursday 3rd November.  I've tried everything to get my service resumed.  My life is at a stand still. I can't even port the number to another network provider because it's not active. 

I need my number back. Kindly get your house in order and resume my service by tomorrow midday.

After instructing an attorney to give notice of  termination of a deceased person's landline and ADSL contract with Telkom, Telkom promptly terminated the service a month later, as requested. The account was fullly paid up until the end of the month during which the service was terminated.
No further accounts were submitted to the attorney and no claim submitted to the executor.
Six months later Telkom handed the account over for collection, the debt collectors referred the matter back to Telkom. Then Telkom advised that the service had been cancelled due to non-payment. The attorney contaced Telkom again. Telkom was requested to submit a claim against the estate or to issue summons, which would be defended.
The account is still debited every month, despite Telkom saying that the service had been cancelled, and the account is still sent to the deceased's unserviced mailbox, despite numerous requests to send all correspondence to the attorney. 
Nobody at Telkom listens and nobody feels like sorting out a problem.

The problem arose in mid-June 2022 when two of our contracts came to an end.  We were struggling financially but agreed to upgrade them.  The voice recording of the interaction with the Consultant included confirmation that the cost per contract will be R99 per month.  They have continued to charge R100 per month.

We have raised this issue with Ms Qaqamba Hlengiwe, Executive Customer Relations (CEO, Executive, National Customer Care and Customer Escalations Desk) but  to no avail.

Two contracts came to an end in August 2022 and we had made it very clear to Mr Hengiwe that we had no intention of upgrading them.
A further contract came to an end in September 2022 and once again we made it clear to Ms Hlengiwe that we had no intention of upgrading it.
Despite ongoing correspondence with Ms Hlengiwe, Telkom continues to charge us for all 5 contracts, completely ignoring our clear instructions that we do not wish to continue with the  3 contracts.
This has been very disappointing as we made it clear we would enter into a new data contract once our complaint had been dealt with and we had reached an amicable resolution of our complaint.

I must be honest, their customer service sucks – unless they phone you to sign a new contract…then they are very friendly.  My bad experiences with them are ongoing.  
1.	Firstly, about 6 months ago I signed a contract for uncapped wi-fi.  It was a special that they were running at the time.  When I received my router, it was the incorrect router and I was on the wrong price scale.  I contacted them, but they just said…the agent must have put in the incorrect data on the system. 
2.	Secondly, they send out a monthly invoice which reflects my home address at the top of the page.	They spelled the street name incorrectly.  I contacted them 4 times now (once every month, because they say they can’t email me the corrected invoice, because it is computer generated once a month).  So after speaking to the agent and they confirmed that my address has been changed, I need to wait till the beginning of next month to receive my invoice so that I can check if my street name has been corrected.  Like I said, it’s been 4 times now that the agent confirmed the street name correction, but when the invoice arrives, it is still incorrectly spelled.  I don’t have many accounts and I need the invoice if I ever need to provide proof of address.  Now the street name is incorrect and I STILL can’t use it as proof of address.  They are putting me in a difficult situation due to their staff that are incapable of changing an address or the system that is faulty, but I am NOT happy with the service and / or lies.  Managers, etc…PLEASE LOOK INTO THE MATTER…
I can’t cancel the contract, because I need to pay a penalty for early settlement and  / or cancellation.  So it’s just not worth it.

The incompetence, rudeness and lack of client care and feedback is of another level.
I have been told an entirely different story every single time I have had to call in. I have never been made aware of anything going on, any new update. Or anything to even state that a new contract was taken out, despite requesting that I be kept in the loop, everytime I'm told ""Yes ma'am I do understand and sense your frustration, I will personally call you"" and NOTHING...!!!

I placed my order on the 18th of October, and was told that the item would be with me WITHIN 7-14 days.
On the 1st of November I called in (this was my 6th call to telkom, out of my own pocket) and the Tele agent said to me that my order was with Courier-it and I will definitely receive the item in Friday or Saturday (4th or 5th Nov) or latest Monday (7th Nov).

Today I call (my now 7th time calling telkom) and the Tele agent says there isn't any stock of my item and neither do they know why i was told the item was in transit. 
??????? 
Why are there so many people telling me so many different stories so many times?
Today, there was absolutely zero concern from your staff. They act superior to the customer and speak in a belittling manner.

I have asked to be put through to a supervisor or manager and was told that they're in back-to-back meetings. Then was told to contact 2 numbers (both of which do not go through) and then was told ""I'm sorry ma'am there's nothing else I can do for you"".???? Neither could the Tele agent provide me with an email address of a higher authority... I was also told that it's only an INBOUND call center and they're unable to call me back. But I have received call backs when my airtime runs out?
 Is this how a business such as telkom is run? 

I am absolutely fed up, now, I cannot even be put through to someone to cancel the contract that was taken. And when you walk into the store they cannot help you because it was done online?

 As a customer, all I would want is regular feedback and HONESTY regarding the status of my order... 
Is this how you live YOUR ""MONATE"". 
Your mission statement that HIGHLIGHTS the honesty and integrity, philosophy, mission, vision and values are rubbish!

I have been with Telkom since the fall of 2015 that’s about 7years and yes there were times of which they were good I just have to say, when I 1st had my contract I was still staying in West Beach and year 2022 I moved to Parklands and the house I moved to is a double story house 
1. On end of February  before moving was supposed to be in March  I went to Telkom office at Bayside and advised that I am moving therefore I would like to move with my line and land line nbr I and they checked on the system and I was told that is possible they will note it.
2. My move was going to delayed  I called the call center advising them they say they don’t see nothing updated but they will note it.
3. Eventually I moved in in the 28April’22 I was given a new nbr and gentleman from Openserve came on the 3May’22 and did his job while he was here I told upstairs there strength of the internet doesn’t reach he said I should give it time it should or I should buy an extender 
4. Bought a p-link extender since upstairs we are struggling to get internet actually it doesn’t reach at all.
5. Called p-link for a set up and it was not working actually it was cutting the telkom WiFi and p-link said the ADSL I have is not compatible.
6. In the middle of the same month May I go Telkom offices bayside and brief them of my issue and the agents recommended that I migrate to a fibre and I won’t have a problem ok I say go ahead.. I was given a form to fill in for the migration and Frogfoot has authority in the area and street.
7. In June I called Telkom to do a follow up they don’t see the request they will note it..
8. July I called again no one see anything but the agent will note it same month I bump into a Telkom office in Table View I brief the agent he checks on the system using my home number and iD number nothing on the system of my request I stayed for an hour I enrolled for this line.. he said it’s now fine and sees that Frogfoot have authority and they do have a contract with them therefore they will do the installation.. ok no problem 
9. Still nothing from Telkom I go to Telkom office Bayside I ask them what is there hold up?.. mmm I don’t know mam I will ask my manager to call you 
10. Till today Bayside manager has never ever called me 
11. End of October I get an sms that my request is been looked into 
12. Frogfoot sends me message that they are on their way there after I receive a call after an hour echo company that works with Frogfoot arrives and starts drilling and doing their part
13. Frogfoot arrives the following morning making sure the fibre is on I asked them where is router and I am told to contact my service provider
14. I drive to Telkom bayside there lady who never seems to know anything there or what works or which doesn’t starts mumbling and eventually says she will ask her colleague her colleague says what ever comment is there means it will be couriered now I remember receiving a message from courier it but did not understand what was it for as I did not order anything.
15. courier it send a a message the following day saying they won’t be sending it anymore they apologize there after I go to Telkom I meet this same girl again she doesn’t know she asked her colleague eventually I’m given a router 
16. I connect router quiet.. called 10210 I’m told the router needs to be configured as they checked on Frogfoot and what not..
17. Telkom technician arrives the following day after the call I show him the line and he tells me he is there for my landline???? What about my landline ? It’s reported faulty when. I ask? 
18. I show him where Frogfoot drilled and I just need the internet to work.. mmmm that’s not my department but let me move the router to adsl line now it’s on there is no password oh eish it needs to be configured. Mam I suggest you go to telkom offices or call them I call the line cuts off
16. I get there I’m just begging for the fibre to work..

So the following day on the 29th October I went to Telkom store and when they check on their system it showed my phone was blacklisted which I didn’t request that. I call Telkom customer care to unblacklist it but they couldn’t do so as the phone was blacklisted by MTN Fraud I have go to MTN for assistance. On Monday 31st October I went to MTN and get help I was assistant by Shimane n Zanele at MTN store in Mokopane.Then they told me that MTN is blacklisting all phone which were stolen from them . So I have Im not using MTN Im using Telkom I have not used MTN. So they requested I bring in PROOF OF PAYMENT, ID COPY & AFFIDAVIT which I did so. Then thats when they told me that they can’t help because MTN in Eastgate Mall on the 08th June 2022 issued the same phone as same mine with the same IMEI No. They even showed to me on a print out.So this means my phone was stolen from MTN they can’t help. As now I m sitting with a phone which not working n I have paid from Telkom. MTN is claiming it was stolen . So on the 1st November 2022 I went back to Telkom to consultant Steven Sithole so that the could email the documents to MTN FRAUD,as instructed by MTN consultant and he refused and walked away from me. I told them I m not going to leave the store until I get assistance. Only when the store was about to close his manager came to me. Took my documents to email. I m sitting with a cellphone that’s not working and without assistance for a full week now

My problem was a network issue only when I am at my complex (my connection was perfect for any other area).

I went into the Bloemfontein Loch Logan store on the 30th of July 2022 to cancel this contract.
 I was assisted on the phone to do the cancellation and I was given a reference saying they will action the request. This was Not done by anyone at Telkom.

I followed this up at the beginning of August and was given a different reference number, when following up by the end of August I was told that the contract will be cancelled in September the 1st.

I was billed in September for the month of August which I have been disputing with Telkom as Telkom did not cancel the contract after a month but only on the 2nd month so they don't do their job and now I am the one liable to pay that contract. 

They are very fast to contact lawyers to call me when they are the ones at fault.
When calling Telkom to resolve this I'm being sent from pillar to post. Been given new references all the time, even the Consultants at Loch Logan branch in Bloemfontein have attitude for days and yet the fault is theirs.

This is the worst service received. Telkom is not taking responsibility nor seeing the fault and this mess done by them, instead they are forcing me to pay for their mistake which is unethical.

They don't have any urgency to assist you as a client. With such experiencing I won't be taking up any contract with Telkom nor will my family.

All I want is for them to fix the mess they have caused.

My insurance premium was for a R20000 cover (R244) meaning if anything happens to my device it will be replaced with a device for that amount. But that wasn't the case with Telkom, instead i was told the below. Yet I have been paying for a cover of R20000, regardless of when I loose the device. Telkom insurance is a scam! 2 weeks later 16 days later and I still do not have my device replaced but they could not hesitate to deduct the insurance premium when I told them to cancel it. 

Ethel-Jean is the agent that ignored all my emails and had the decency to tell me, they only reply after 48 hours, while I'm out of a device I use for work.

I had a 24 month contract with telkom for a internet line and phone line. The 24 months would have ended june 2022. 

Ive paid my debit order /monthly subscription every month as request however after the 24 months twlkom continued deducting payments. I realised i have to ""cancel"" the contract/subscription in order to stop this. 

As i work during the week , i spent half of my saturday trying to get in touch with an operator because telkoms online chat is ****ing useless. Upon speaking to an agent in customer care, i was assured that my contract has been cancelled and that will be followed by my final bill. As i relocated end of june and have not used telkoms service since then, the agent advised that i can dispute my final bill once received. 


This was all understood and I took reaponsibility that i contributed to this issue so it was borderline okay if i didnt get my money back. 

However, we are now in October and telkom is still deducting debit orders for a service i no longer use and requested to cancel. If rolse were reverse and i skipped a payment, telkom would surely chase for the payment. With technology today can telkom really say that they are unaware that i stopped using their service. That it is okay to collect money even after me getting in touch and asking to cancel it. This is causing myself financial detriment because your platforms and agents are incompetent. I call the same ****ing number today 30/10/2022 and now its outside operating hours


I have managed to attempt cancelation on your site, of which i received the following text :""Telkom Cancellation Case: ********** has been logged for Service **********"" . I have no ****ing hope that it will be cancelled as speaking to a human did not get the job done, so i have less faith in your website self-service paltform.


I would like this canceled,  i would like money due to me given back. I would like this delt with ****ing asap.

Th ek consultant told me they will be receiving stock the coming week. A week later I phoned again, still no stock. The consultant told me that I should go to an Istore and get a phone because they wont get stock soon. 

I was upset and told her Telkom could at-least inform clients when they don't have stock of an order. She went off at me saying how many clients they have and how do I expect them to inform everyone!

Telkom discontinued ADSL in area and moved us to Fixed Wireless Broadband Service. In Feb 2021 i requested Telkom to cancel TIN********** and applied for 2 stand-alone e-mail accounts which were created and am paying for them (TIN********** & TIN**********). On the customer portal, the 2 e-mails under the old TIN********** appear closed and the new stand-alone e-mail accounts appear Active.  However, the new stand-alone e-mail accounts (Active) are not working, and the old ones (Closed) are still active. However, i am not able to change passwords on old e-mails as they appear ""Closed"".    

I have been to Telkom shop at Vaal Mall several times for assistance without any help. I phoned Telkom several times without any assistance. In Feb 2021 i went to Telkom shop at Vaal Mall to have TIN********** closed and was given Ref no.: **********0. In all my queries with Telkom i was given ticket ref nos., but without any assistance and every time i was told the matter has been escalated. On the 24 Sept 2022 i was given ticket ref no.: ********** which was closed on the 26 Sept 2022 and was subsequently given another ref no.: ********** (over the phone & no sms) and the Telkom agent said she has escalated the matter, but nothing has happened since. 
At Telkom shop, Vaal Mall, I demonstrated to a Telkom agent by logging onto webmail using my closed e-mail account and the Telkom agent was surprised to see that it was working and new one not working.   
The scary part is that I receive e-mails from hackers saying that they have now hacked my e-mail account and even show me my e-mail password and I do not even have a means of changing the password because the e-mail accounts appear closed on customer portal. This is putting my other private information at risk. Several attempts are being made to use my e-mail address to open accounts.  I only survive by continuously checking and deleting my e-mails because I fear that some else is also receiving my e-mails. 
I am not sure if I need to go the Legal route to force Telkom rectify this issue before something big happen with my private information. This service is appalling and putting me in danger, and it appears nobody from Telkom cares about this or someone at Telkom is complicit to this situation.

Which I said yes I did (3 times).

I then went on to Twitter, where I lodged the complain again to Telkom SA, they gave me a ref Number **********9 where they said that they will investigate the matter and it will take between 2 to 72 hours to resolve the matter that was on Sunday 23 October 2022, today it is Thursday 27 October 2022 and still the matter is not resolved yet, I am paying for a service that I am currently not receiving, I must not think that Telkom will give me a discount for the inconvenience caused  all that they can say is ""sorry for the inconvenience caused we will contact you once the matter has been resolved""

This is really unacceptable I would understand it if I was not paying for the service But I am up to date with the payments the least that Telkom can do from their side is to resolve this matter as they are a service provider. when following up on Twitter all that they can say is that they will get back to me.",Telkom,telkom,non-compliance-from-telkom-side-4150889,0,[],https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/hp-cdn-01/uploads/orgs/org_793962_logo_hPUx0SvDxJ768HorIPr8.png,/static/img/industries/icons/telecommunications-icon.jpg,Telecommunications,telecommunications,1,,WEBSITE,False,,2022-06-29,2,[]

3. I asked her when she did the upgrade how much was the remaining actual figure I was supposed to pay for the Device, she didn't know but she said I will only be paying the R672 for 4 months, which was June 2022 - September 2022.

They continued to debit 100, now they increased the payments to 105 which idk what is it for because they no longer have authority to debit my account. I reversed the 2 debit orders which I recently picked up.

I gave all the information banking details, before I even make the 1st payment my account was scammed I told them I went to the branch 01.07.2022 and they gave me a statement to go and pay at PEP I did so as attached my proof of payment. I went back again to the branch they said I am not owing they show -R1.00 and they gave a number to call when I was told. The reason I call or go to branch office was because of the confusing SMS's that doesn't make sense one will be your account is paid and the next you are owing, if I call the call center the voice will tell me your account balance is R59.90 if which I do agree I will make payment on the 27.10.2022 

They never try to debit my bank in these 3 months of which I believed they got a notice that I closed it, now in October they debit me I got a notification from Std Bank of  Telkom unpaid reversed, again in a week they did they same sending Telkom unpaid. I am owing Std Bank R147.00 by 2 now in one month, if they say I am R201 that is for one month unpaid reversal and they claim they have been sending notification to Std Bank why then I am owing for only one month?  I couldn't close the account for some reasons but my salary is no longer paid to them.
The call center lady told me I should not go to Telkom shop they know nothing, how will I know that I asked her, where was I suppose to go? She told me my word will be against theirs because there was no recording. I wanted to go to the higher H/O    to get clarity coz she said we at billing do this but it was collection who did that and insisting I am owing. I ask the address she gave me Johannesburg one   I told her but I said I am in Cape Town she gave me a phone number to call ********** to ask them. My account is suspended after all those calls I made. I was told on the other branch that i went to on the 01.09.2022 when i ask why they do not suspend me if I am owing? He said no they will not to the other branch I went where I open my account they ask me , are you still getting data I said yes they said so you are not owing please call them this is not the 1st complain about the same issue, WEDNESDAY MY ACCOUNT WAS SUSPENDED. The billing center refuse to give me the manager email address not even contact number she said she will send an email to her manager and till today I am waiting for the email with the H/O address I spoke to Nombuso Mseleku. I had to go back to the branch in need of help but I found that they have changed the statement now it show that I am owing R201 even the automated response from Telkom before they suspended my account it was saying you are owing R59.90 of which I knew I need to pay month end, now is changed to R201.00 as the lady at the billing center said to me it will be your word against us. Billing is a mess they mess with our account as they told me at the branch I am not the 1st customer complaining about the same issue 

I am unable to load the proof of what I am referring to. You even lock my airtime I bought  

I need the manager of Telkom to answer I got all proof of payment.

After installation the guy who assisted said that they would log a call for Telkom to assist me remotely because there seemed to be an issue with my profile which is why they cannot activate my line and that I should report any other fault/s within 30 days. Roughly 1.5 weeks later I contacted the guy who did the installation and asked if he logged the call for me to be assisted which did not happen and was advised to report this to Telkom myself.

I reported the issue to Telkom who phoned almost a week later to help and was still unable to assist. Instead, I was given a temp profile to use and was told it would expire after a day whilst they proceeded to close the ticket I logged for assistance without resolving the actual issue.\

I been trying to cancel my subscription with Telkom since Aug, and to date I'm still being billed for a fibre line that hasn't worked since installation, in fact they confirmed the last time the device was even powered on was end of Aug so not sure what I'm being billed for. Also, according to my own calculation, it seems that they are billing me for the full month of July even though the line was installed the end of that month. 

My account has now been handed over to attorneys for non-payment despite me phoning into Telkom twice to dispute this. When phoning in to dispute the matter, you are given a ref (I now have 2 refs for the same issue reported) and told they would provide feedback in 7-14 days and a month later still no feedback, which I assume is a delay tactic so they can continue to bill me and mess up my credit rating.

Furthermore, I tried contacting the attorneys they handed my account over too twice last week and both times for whatever reason was given, I was told by P&P Attorneys that they would phone me back, still waiting for that phone call.

Despite having great service in store, I was very disappointed to be told that the printed and online brochure was incorrect as there was no way in getting the combo / bundle deal i was after, printed in the brochure?  This was not due to a stock issue but rather the consultant and store manager in store advised that they had received no communication from head office around the specific deal and confirmed it was wrong as they were not even getting the specific product in stock.  I asked if it could be manually added to my contract and that also wasnt possible.  This is false advertising at its best and my first impressions on my telkom journey are not good at all due to this. 

I am very disappointed as i believe i am entitled to what was advertised.  This was not an online specific promo, nor was it related to stock issues.  It was valid in that the brochure stipulates that it is valid from 1 October to 31 October 2022.  I opened the new contract on 23/10/2022.

This was reported to Telkom and a request made for a sim swap on 09 October 2022. The Telkom branch in Three Rivers indicated that this was a fixed line contract (postpaid) and the request had to be processed in Vaal Mall, Vanderbijlpark or Mall of the South. My mother and I went to Vanderbijlpark and were told that the request would be processed and the service would be available on Tuesday (11/10/2022), no reference number was given and no indication made that the stolen sim had been blocked. 

The Vanderbijlpark branch could not help to blacklist the phone and I was referred to customer care (10210) - a Telkom number, which was not useful as the Telkom sim card was stolen (We later went to the Three Rivers branch and the phone was blacklisted).

The sim card provided was inactive on Tuesday (11/10/2022). As there is no telephone number for the branch, we went to the Vanderbijlpark branch on Wednesday and were given the reference number ********** and told the service would be available on Thursday. I again indicated that this was a matter of urgency- the phone was stolen and my mother needed the phone as she is elderly and requires a phone, especially when she is alone or in the event of an emergency. 

The card was inactive on Thursday. We (again) went to the Telkom Vanderbijlpark store on Saturday. I was told the matter had not been escalated and could only be attended to on Monday (17/10/2022). I again reiterated that the phone had been stolen and that it was a matter of urgency that service be restored. I was again referred to 10210 to file a complaint. I was also told that the matter had then been escalated to Nono Zwane at Three Rivers.

I called Ms. Zwane on Tuesday (18/10/2022), who only then escalated the matter. I called her a number of times but the issue was not resolved and she could not give a time frame for when it would be resolved. 

I also logged a fault on 30591 but this was also closed without being resolved.

Despite informing staff a number of times that the card had been stolen I do not believe that Telkom blocked the stolen sim card. Given that the criminals had almost 2 weeks of free airtime and data, In addition to dealing with all the issues surrounding a robbery, I expect the next Telkom account to be another source of misery. 

Mom finally closed the account as there (1) seemed to be no prospect of the service being restored. (2) Telkom provided no feedback on the stolen sim; or the replacement sim. (3) There was no point in paying for a service that Telkom was not providing or making an effort to restore.

How much to do a Sim Swap and why their prices varies from shop to shop. I have done a sim swap today around 2 to 3 o'clock today at Telkom Newtown branch in Johannesburg and was I assisted by the lady by the name Natalie who insited that I pay R10 upfront or she is not going to help me. prior to that I was coming from Ghandi square where I was charged R35 unfortunately for them the system went offline. Last week Ghandi square branch , the guy wanted to charge me R40 and the system went offline and asked me to come back some other time but both the Ghandi square lady(Consultant) and the gentlemen( Consultant) whare very kind and welcoming but that does not make them safe from this metter.

The Newtown Lady(Natalie) was sarcastic and disrespectful to me when I asked her as why is Telkom sim swap charges  varies from shop to shop. Her Answer was"" It is just the way it is and I need to decide whether I want to do a simswap or not. all I am saying is that you have to pay without payment I cannot assist you( Laughing out loud as the utter those words. I then advised her that I need to find out from telkom as why is this happening i don't mind paying I just have a problem with different charges for the same service. She asked ""where are you going to report this? "" I said Telkom customer service she once again Laughed out Loud as if she knows that I will not succeed. I told her that she is being sarcastic she said she can cancel the sim swap if I don't want her assistance. Well  she continued and the siswap was susscessfull and and I paid R10 and there was n receipt. The level of disrespect and I felt undermined by her and there was a guy sitting behind her and never said anything about Natalie's behaviour. ICCID No. ********************34

I cancelled my telkom wifi  subscribtion on time using the my telkom portal and Telkom continued to bill me incorrectly for 3 months. Then they handed the unpaid bill to NuDebt Management.  i tried to query this with them but i struggled to get their customer services on 081 180.  i could not even get customer services email details until they handed they debt over.  i no longer had strenght to fight so i decided to pay off the debt.  

i  made a schedule payment to pay it off and forgot about it and decided to do the EFT payment of the same amount.  When i realised that i double paid, i sent the 2 POPs to NuDebt- their collectors who referred me back to Telkom.  

i went to their branch in Menlyn and was told CS will call but that never happened.  By God's Grace on this special day i managed to get through to CS and they acknowledged that they can see a credit on my account.  i told them that i would like a refund.   i had to resend POP thou the credit is there.   I waited 2 weeks and there was no response....  i googled and managed to get Telkom Kenya CS email and sent my query to them.  it's only then that i managed to get some response from Executive Customer Relations - (CEO, Executive, National Customer Care and Customer Escalations Desk) who forwarded my query to Credit Management.  After 3 days i got a response from her to say:  The feedback from our Credit management is that:
""The credit on this account is not refundable. 
This payment was made to us (Telkom) by our External debt Collectors as the customer was handed over and will cover legal cost.""

The amount that i paid them already included legal fees....  what other legal fees are they talking about.  if i hadnt paid the double amount where would they have recieved these legal costs?

I even went the FaceBook route, to no avail. In December of 2021 I logged a dispute with TransUnion regarding this INVALID debt, the credit bureau rule this invalid and had it removed from my credit profile. Now in October 2022 yet another debt collection company is calling, smsing me regarding this **** and the amount somehow is now R1942.53.

Cancellation was logged in January 2021, but Telkom did nothing. Cancellation was logged again in August 2021 (after many calls with Telkom still resulted in no response), and despite receiving written confirmation of the cancellation on then Telkom online portal, Telkom still did not disconnect the services and continued to charge for services not used anymore.  Every time I enquired, I would get sales calls from Telkom to sell me more services, but no one helped to stop what was cancelled months ago. As if buying more bad quality services would make me change my mind. I realised that while I continue paying the bills (to keep my side clear) Telkom will continue to bleed me, their customer, dry. So, I stopped (after paying 6 months' worth of Telkom bills). Eventually after another 6 months ...
... enduring Telkom's bully tactics through debt collectors, 
... going to the Telkom shop several times to talk to a living person (because no response/action via the online portal despite the message that someone will call you), and
... providing the same proof and supporting documentation to different people and different departments 
... trying to get Telkom's incompetent employees to do the right thing (cancel my subscriptions and reimburse me for all the payments I made after receiving written confirmation of cancellation)
Telkom eventually stopped all the services that I subscribed to, but instead of reimbursing me or writing back erroneously charges and paying back my line deposit, the bully tactics via debt collectors has started again!!!
Why??? Because incompetent Telkom employees from the different departments fail to work together to reach the correct account balance. Telkom owes me R3956.50.

OPENSERVE were here in a few days and yesterday on 17/10/2022 (Monday) in the morning installed the fibre line extension and made the link up - they were quick and professional.

However today (Tuesday- a day later) we had our first power outage in the afternoon - once the power had come back on I noticed the new fibre router ""Internet link""  light had turned RED - hmmmm, (my old ADSL package never did this), after waiting maybe 10 minutes I realised the internet signal ain't coming back on it's own and phoned the Helkom Tech help center.

Well this is where the non-fun started (again with Telkom) - I had to go through a longish re-setting"" procedure(paperclip reset) as it was explained that the D-LINK router, yes !!!, the ""new tech"" that Telkom had just installed just over 24 hours ago ""does not re-link itself automatically to the internet"" after a power outage as it was not designed for power outages.

Interestingly, the previous ADSL router(""old technology"" package) that I had just given up to 'upgrade to TELKOM fibre used to automatically reset itself EVERY time - no problems. and NO phoning the Telkom helpline on any occasion at any time - it was plain n simple to use the ADSL router setup....with NO cellphone ""wi-fi"" resets needed.

So here I was today on the phone with Telkom tech trying to get my internet link back after 1 day of Telkoms ""high tech"" installation . After following help-line instructions opening this page and that page on the Router settings /admin settings/instructions and having to follow a RESET and a line check and this and that and.???....I asked the very helpful help assistant if I would have to do this every time we have a power outage, the answer was affirmative, EVERY time I would have to phone in and do the Helkom schlepp thing and reset the fibre router line by phoning into the Telkom help center.
Now the ADSL I had just given up used to automatically RESET itself with NO PROBLEMS - so ?????
In addition I now also had to relink/reset my cellphones ""wifi"" alongside the reset procedure and sure as hell my cellphone now has problems with it's wifi handshaking(never had this before) - it was after a few attempts that I mentioned to the assistant that I cannot see myself having to phone in and do the reset procedure EVERY TIME with my new fibre router AND my cellphone ""wi-fi"" every time there is a power outage - I gave up ""resetting"" my cellphone after having followed instructions a few times unsuccessfully.
oh - and did I mention my wifes' cellphone cannot handshake with the ""wi-fi"" now either - it was working perfectly yesterday from the ADSL package.
The help assistant also mentioned I can avoid ALL THIS by DISCONNECTING my fibre router just before the power outages occur - to avoid the helpline reset procedure everytime. - huh!!!!
i) sometimes the power outage does not occur according to the schedule supplied by the Municipality and sometimes power outages occur during sleeping hours etcetc.,,,
ii) and sometimes power outages simply just happen - this is South Africa.

In short I am MUCH WORSE off giving up my ADSL line (which automatically resets itself and re-links automatically) after any power outage - what a pleasure the old ADSL line was.
I was informed that the Telkom D-Link fibre router is ""not designed"" for power outages and power loss circumstances - is Telkom kidding me and the public?

I however wish not to carry on explaining the rest, but I feel TELKOM (as usual) is fooling people BIGTIME and using false marketing tactics only to supply ignorant people like myself with a worse package/worse technology than the old trusted ADSL line used to supply against the backdrop scenario of all the known power outages occurring.

According to TELKOM - I have 7 days ""cooldown period"" to cancel the Fibre line ""new package"" which I think I will be utilising - I have phoned the 10213.....ext, 5 number (which rang) and then instructed me to link into my Telkom ??? webpage/app?? to record my cancellation of my order - apparently I have 7 days cooldown period after installation to achieve this.

Nowhere on any occasion was this ""tech complexity"" ever mentioned or explained to me, if it had been I would have simply chosen to stay with my trusty ADSL package ""forever"" as Eskom's repair prospects certainly don't look like being successful, well at least not before the second coming of the Messiah , however the constant ""harassment"" of Telkom marketing - sometimes 3...4 ... phone calls a week sometimes, eventually wore me down to take the ""new fibre package"".

Telkom surely is aware of the fibre reset problems after power outages, on this I am willing to bet a months pension, however they seem to find it expedient and convenient NOT to mention this ""router problem"" when selling a ""new package"" to customers.

I was told that the June payment only reflects.

We've been struggling for 4-5 weeks now just to divert the landline to another line for when the landline is either busy or not working with absolutely shocking customer service

Firstly I went into the branch where they told me I can't do it there and was given a number to phone. After struggling to get through we finally managed to talk to Ngowethu Mathunjwa where she explained that I need to send her a letter to approve this function on my landline. This letter was send 19 September 2022. After numerous emails afterwards to her to find out what is going on with the progress and no response from her I've received an email from Lorraine Koetzee on 5 October 2022, with the response that my request for forward call has been activated with an instruction manual of how to activate it on our side. These instructions didn't work at all, and we had to follow up again where the only response from Lorraine was that there is a block call on the line and we need to somehow know how to deactivate that. Numerous emails afterward to her with again, no response.

We've been phoning the two number that was given to us (one in the branch and one by Ngowethu) endlessly and was just send back and forth to every department and no one assisting us, or wanted to assist us or even had the knowledge to assist us. Absolutely shocking. My assistant finally managed to get through Nontobeko, on 12 October 2022, that wanted to help and was pleasant to talk to and she informed her that the forward call function was not activate and we need to send an approval letter. This letter has been send on 19 September 2022 already! Since then we have been trying to get hold of Nontobeko.  Every time we call she is busy on the line and we've been told that they are sending her a call request to call is. We are at 18 October 2022 with no response from anyone.

I'm appalled by the service delivery from Telkom and everyone working there. How hard can it be to just had this simple function.

I am trying to cancel my telkom line and adsl internet. 30day notification as required was sent on the 13th of September 2022. Received a refrence and verbal confirmation that our service will terminate on 13 October 2022 not later than 12pm on this date. 
Been caling Telkom from the 14th to enquire why service was not terminated as per agreement. One of the operaters I spoke to said we must just unplug the phone and adsl rooter. The audacity to even suggest it, boggels my mind. Incompetent comes to mind because it could not be that difficult te cancell the services in question. We did switch off the internet to make sure no one can use it and we also don't make any calls.. but I know from previous experience they will send me a bill for services, even after cacellation. 
Telkom it is unacceptable, and I would think twise in future to make use of your services. 

I am furious with Telkom because every time you call them you get a new operator on line and you have to start from the beginning. I was told today that I should phone them again tomorrow and every day after that. Why give 30day notice? They should pull finger and do their job, but no they make it most difficult for the user who dared try to leave them.. for **** sakes cancel my services and get it done today.

I had a contract with telkom and had to upgrade, when the time came, I went to TDS Centurion. 
During my upgrade at the shop, an insurance was sold to me to insure my device. I took the insurance and I believed that my device was insured incase anything happens.
When I took the insurance, nothing was explained to me but was told that if it happens that I loose the device, I can claim on the insurance.
Unfortunately in July I lost the device an I claimed it by giving the needed documents.

After submitting the relevant documents, my claim was rejected because of reasons that were not communicated to me at the time of signing up with the insurance.

I lost the device in July 26 if I'm not mistaken, in the month of August the insurance deducted their premium which to me doesn't make sense because they are aware that I have lost the device and have claimed it. I reversed the debit order and telkom put me on areas. All of this doesn't make sense to me because nothing Is being fairly communicated to me as a client.

I've been paying insurance premiums for the device and not the sim, why when I have lost the device my claim is being rejected...
Why do they still deduct money from my account where as I've lost the device, what am I insuring?
I really would like my claim to be taken forth so that I get what is due to me.
Im left with no phone, I'm on areas for wrong reasons and wasn't helped with my claim.

When I go back to the shop to cancel the insurance, they tel me that they can't but I must do it on my own, still it doesn't make sense to me because I was given the insurance in the shop, why whe I wanna cancell I be sent out to make calls on my own.

As normal people that have contracts do, it is time to upgrade. So, check the due date for when Upgrade date is......Now using technology..USSD feature...good I can see date is 9 OCt...

After getting ready, checking which Phone which contract...done..

Now I go the store in Menlyn, very friendly as always. I tell them I want to upgrade, they say no problem , which products we are looking at possibly. During the discussion of which colour and and and, I ask them to check on the second contract, what will be the amount if I decide to upgrade earlier ( 1 month earlier) as I want to make a decision to do them at the same time for me and my wife.

Next thing we are told we would only be able to upgrade 2 days later. So I ask how can this be, as my USSD code said 9th Oct.

They explain that on the system of theirs, it shows that we can only upgrade on midnight, 10th Oct , then technicaly only the next day, which now is the 11th Oct.

I show them here, the USSD said 9th Oct, which today is the 9th, we know how calendars works.

I asked them, if I should upgrade today, what will be the cost implication, if not too bad, I can make a decision. R1509 ...WHAAAAAAAAAT???

There is no ways. I can understand the one for next month if that is the cost.

I ask who can assist in the shop to sort the problem out, no one. Now I get on the phone and call customer care ... Me and the lady on line are having an argument, because, from their side , on 24 month contract, I can only upgrade 2 months before the time of the contract actual 24 month period ,(1st time to ever hear this) . If I decide to upgrade now, at 4 months before the time, it is considered early upgrade and I still have to pay the R1509.

Good afternoon,

I would like to lodge a formal complaint about the lack of effective service received from Telkom with my latest upgrade AND request feedback about how the matter will be rectified. 

On the 13th of September 2022, my husband, and I went to Telkom's Menlyn branch to do a cellphone upgrade. The phone selected was in stock and was well received. We decided to add a Samsung Galaxy watch 4 to the contract, which was not in stock at the time of purchase. We were informed by the consultant that a shipment was expected the following week and we were assured that the waiting time would not exceed two weeks. 

To date, we have been waiting 3 weeks and 3 days for the watch. We have followed up 9 times with the consultant via WhatsApp and 3 times with the branch manager via email. Both individuals have indicated (each time) that they are awaiting shipment and that it will be delivered soon. The manager also indicated that he has escalated the matter to head office with no helpful response. 

I believe that this waiting time for a product is absolutely unacceptable and completely absurd. We have been clients of Telkom for at least 5 years and have never had such a problem.",Telkom,telkom,telkoms-lack-of-effective-service-and-delivery-4124296,0,[],https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/hp-cdn-01/uploads/orgs/org_793962_logo_hPUx0SvDxJ768HorIPr8.png,/static/img/industries/icons/telecommunications-icon.jpg,Telecommunications,telecommunications,1,,WEBSITE,False,,2021-08-31,1,[]

The application was successful in August and the devices were given to me. The first scheduled payment date was for the end of September 2022.

To my surprise, Telkom breach every rule of POPIA and opposed to debiting the business account which was all part of the application, they debited my personal account and deducted the funds without my authorization from my personal banking.

Not only does this breach POPIA, but it is theft as i have not given permission to Telkom to access my personal information. 

in addition, when visiting the branch I was advised that all Telkom can do is apologize and put the correct details in the system and it was an error from their end as they used my ID number to link the account and not the business details. 

Furthermore, when i asked about the refund, i was advised that Telkom does not do refunds and i should ask my company to reimburse me and from the following month it will be taken from the correct account. 

The money was extremely easy to take from my account but it cannot be done.

lastly, this has gone as far as linking these contracts to my personal credit report which now affect my affordability and brought down my credit scoring as enquiries were done on my account. 

The Manager in the Canal Walk Branch first sent a consultant back and forth to me before I had to eventually request to speak to him direct.

I went to the branch in Cavendish Square, where the consultant showed that the amount debited 3 days ago was still not reflecting on their side. Gave him a copy of my bank statement providing proof of the debit order.
Consultant advised that the debit order was from a Collecting Agency outsourced by Telkom and they have not updated Telkom's systems!!!
Firstly, I was not in arrears, secondly who the @@@ gave this agency the wright to debit my account (i had an agreement with Telkom not them). This is illegal! 
The story gets better - I discovered also that Telkom was charging me an extra R200 on occasional months, when their debit order goes through before the end of the day of the last month, ie, at 02h00 on 30th or 31st, and not after 22h00, Sometimes the debit order goes through before the day agreed. It gets paid manually then. What a rip-off and to charge R200???? the banks do not charge them!
I want to in future cancel the debit orders and rather pay manually on 31/30th to ensure it is paid - no luck with them.

As of now at 4pm, still disconnected, lost about R5,000 of business due to this!!!

Fibre account: **********43 (R720.01) > invoice, contract & T&Cs attached
LTE account: **********06 (R899.00) > invoice attached

I have many contracts with Telkom and extremely disappointed and highly upset! 

Their DSL department contacted me end June 2022 to upgrade my LTE contract, which I had since 1 June 2021, to a higher speed line. I requested that I actually want to move over to a fibre package and do not want to double billed during the transition. Their consultant, Mia Hattingh, advised that I would not be double billed as it was a migration.

Your mobile sales department have been contacting often after the above call from DSL, and I was very upset because no one was getting back to me on the order for fibre. I was again confirmed with their Mobile sales department that because this is a migration from LTE to fibre, I would NOT be double billed, and I would NOT have to return the LTE router as I could use it with my other 3G sim cards.

Process that happened:
Received call from Mia Hattingh (DSL) on 28 June 2022 to upgrade LTE speed as contract was in place for 1 year
Vumatel only installed the fibre on Monday 15 August 2022
Telkom Fibre D-link telkom router arrive Wednesday 24 August 2022
TIN********** received Thursday 25 August 2022 and your tech department assisted me to set it up
Telkom LTE D-link router switched off and packed away
After all the above, I am still DOUBLE BILLED! 
My bank account has already been debited for my Fibre account: **********43 (R720.01), and I have received an invoice for my old LTE account: **********06 (R899.00) and have received SMSes that my account will be debited with the amount via debit order.

Please rectify urgently that I am not debited for my old LTE account: **********06 (R899.00) as this was a migration to fibre.

If their call centre agents did not do what they needed to do and/or did not update your systems accordingly, that is not my fault! 

Many thanks

For some reason at the end of July ... Telkom decided to debit my account earlier ... by that i mean on the night of the 24 /25th. So the debit bounced back and so I waited to see the  if you guys will debit again on the 25th but that didn't happen - so then on the 27th of July I went onto my ABSA banking app and did a payment directly to Telkom. There-after Telkom debited my account again. 

So at the end of August there was no actual bill payment due only a R202.00 return debit order fee - upon which again they tried to debit earlier ... so  this time when my salary went into my account I did not do an EFT due to the issue from the previous month ... I waited for Telkom to debit - however this did not happen.

Then towards the end / middle of September I contact Telkom to change my debit order to the 30th as I was tired of having returned debit orders on my account for no apparent reason. I was advised this can only be done as at the end of October as this takes 30 days to activate this request. I then made arrangements for other funds to be in my account before my salary even went in. 

Then to my surprise this month I was not debited on the 24 or the 25th - however Telkom just suspended my line without any notification to me. 

I then called in and was advised incorrectly by so many consultants as follows: 
1. I should go onto the Telkom portal and make payment to re-activate the line - upon which i tried to and was not successful. 
2. I was then advised to go make an easy payment at any store upon which my line will be re-activated immediately - I went into the Telkom store and was advised this wont be possible.
3. I was advised that if I do an EFT - my line will only be re-activated after 48 hours - but there is no guarantee that i wont be debited again as well. 
4. I was advised one bill payment was R700 approx and then by another consultant R900 approx. 

All this incorrect info, early debits which were not my fault and two fees of R202 each and then you guys debited my account on Thursday night of R900 approx BUT my LINE IS STILL SUSPENDED !!!!

I called on Friday and was told my query with be escalated and my line will be up in 5 to 12 hours and then again on Saturday i was told the same story.

Oh and I was also advised managers will call me back but to date not a call.

I phoned customer care and they informed me that the debit order failed, They also said if we pay trough a third party it  takes 3 days to reflect.

Customer care told us that if we want to make a payment we should do it directly on their website and payment will reflct almost emmediately.

MONTH 3 on contract: We made an electronic payment to Telkom from their website as per instruction from customer care, We made the payment 2 days before the debit order, all went well and twelve days after debit order date our account was once again blocked. I phoned customer care who told me that my phone should be working, I must just restart it. After restarting my phone my account was still blocked, I waited 48 hours and phoned them again.

I had taken a WiFi contract for 12 months with telkom while Telkom had a promotion running at R399 per month and a couple of months later there is a price increase on the contract. 
When I call to enquire, I am informed that Telkom had an increase across the board on their products and apparently they are allowed to increase a promotional contract. 
This does not make sense to me, if there is a promotion and a contract in place for that promotion how can there be a price increase?  If I take a cell ohone contract or any other contract the fixed amount for that contract is the amount I pay through the contract period. 
This makes me doubt the itergrity of this company, are the promotions run as a ploy to get people to sign up and then increase the premiums to what they actually want, some may say this is entrapment. 
The increase in their premiums does not make them competitive in the current market but you are contractually obligated to them.
The cherry on top is that the amount of the initial contract gets debited from my bank account and I now I have to pay the difference from the new premium manually or they will disconnect my service.

- I have been having issues with my invoice since August 2022, i have spoken to 8 different agents, nobody can resolve my issue and when i request to speak to a manager i get told i would receive a callback from the manager, its now 29/09/2022 and i have not received one phone/email from any manager.
- Every time i call through to the call center wanting to get my issue resolved as my phone is suspended, i must first hear agents children making a noise in the background, music playing loud and then i get told by the agent i need to call other department, however i already called the correct department but because agents do not want to assist me as they are in the lazy mood i get told to call another department, UNPROFESSIONAL!
i called telkom call center yesterday (28/09/2022) based in Johannesburg, to be be hanged up and then i made a call today (29/09/2022) to the call center to speak with the 8th agent to assist me then to be told that there was NEVER A CASE LODGED for me since i spoke with all 7 staff members from the call center of Telkom SA in Johannesburg. 
- In Mid Month i was told my the agent i would be refunded R590, however when the agent ""Ongezwa Bobotyana"" check she saw there was no credit/refund provided nor was there any case raised or notes on the account, on top of that whenever i request from agents to send me a ref number and their name they say they will send it via sms when the call is done, however no ref number nor no name gets sent which is once again UNPROFESSIONAL.
- TELKOM i want my issue to be resolved because this is causing me inconvenience as my cell phone number is blocked.

My Query is that i was charged for calls and for subscribes, as i explained to the 8 staff call center agents from TELKOM that i upgraded my contract in sometime in June 2022 the very next day i updated my spend limit to R30, however because of telkom having system issues my spend limit did not update on their system because they were facing system issues, and this was told me by about 4 agents that telkom did face system issues, so why should i be held liable for a providers system issues due to my spend limit not being updated!????????

2nd query is that i was charged for subscriptions i have subscribed to which is a website i do not know never heard of before, i explained to the agent i use most of the time WiFi, i hardly use my mobile data and on top of that i do not subscribe to anything hence because i know it accumulates charges hence why i would never ever subscribe to anything and also how do i benefit from a subscription i was charged for when i never ever went on that website???!!!!

ALSO I WAS PROMISED A CREDIT BY AN AGENT WHICH WAS NEVER DONE AND I WOULD LIKE THE CREDIT TO BE APPLIED TO MY ACCOUNT!!!!

Finally a case was raised by the 8th agent i spoke with today.

I have been a loyal customer all the time!!!!!!!!!!

I get my invoice sent to me for August don't think much of it as I asked for debit order and then I received  my September invoice with late fees and call the centre to enquire and told that there was no debit order on account asked if I could add it and then was told that due to being a new client I have to wait for 3 months for a debit order to be added and stated that I use the online system and asked her why the debit order was not added on she stated that it not her problem i should speak to sales which i dont understand because all departments are connected but they just lazy to do they job. 

I log on the system and it starts giving me problem and does not want to add my account in order for me to pay and kept stating that the system had an error and should try again and this went on for 2 days. I called them again for assistance and kept being dump on to different departments for help no one helped and I ended up asking for a manager and the consultant kept me on hold for 20 minutes and then dropped the call on me.

I had to take half day from job to go to their branch in Trade Route Mall only to get there and they were closed due to loadshedding the only store in the entire mall closed even though there is solar power available at the mall. I had to wait 2 and half hours for the store to open and when it did there was 3 customers in the store and I had to wait another 30 minutes while they called out numbers of people who were not there.
I eventually decided to cancel the service effective the 30 September has I already paid in advance for the month. They canceled my service on the 24 September and refused to refund me until the 10 October when the new statement is available. I spoke to a consultant that Friday and told me that I was called and told of the cancelation date but I received no call and asked if it is scheduled for the 30 September stated yes but it was not. Called on Monday in regards to the early cancelation and I'm told something different and asked them to send the call to the branch the consultant kept refusing and stated that she was confused and than blind transfers me to the consultant I spoke to instead of getting the call recording like I asked it took half an hour for her to actually ask her manager to get the call but kept ignoring my request.

I would not recommend telkom to anyone.
I was told to constantly redial as I was in the wrong department to sort out querie they will send you to every department and you will never resolve it and was told the same thing by the branch manager when I told him the experience I had with the call centre when I call in for assistance. He stated that the reason for cancelation and why people go in to the branch. 

I do not see the point of the call centre if people still have to go into the branch due to incompetence staff.

I'd like to convey my dissatisfaction with the service I've received from Telkom. I had been told I would be billed prorated for the first month, which was not the case; instead, I had been debited in whole, therefore I had disputed that debit. Now I'm getting charged more than I should be. For example, on September 23rd, I was debited R1477.80 when my debit was intended to be R799 each month. Then, this morning, I get an email with a letter of demand for R1477.80, which has already been deducted from my account. The previous month I had been debited R1,018.20.

Could someone please help me with this before I go legal?

I desire to terminate my contract and return this phone; I will not pay any binding costs, nor will I be held liable for any breaches of the remaining contract.
I'd prefer do business with a reputable network provider, such as Vodacom, than with you.

I have been a Telkom mobile customer for longer than I can remember, excellent reception, service, products, fees etc. never had any serious issue, my contract has since ended, so I proceeded to take out a new one, leaving the mobile behind as I love my current phone, and choosing to take out a LTE Router bundle with a Laptop as again, it was a brilliant deal that even the dudes at Incredible connection said, telling me to not even consider buying a laptop cash as the contract in TOTAL worked out cheaper than the retail price of the laptop and I got a large amount of data with it what a win! Or so I thought.

firstly to obtain the contract Telkom's sales team cut the call while putting me on hold multiple times over two months, speaking to multiple agents asking them not to do the same thing the previous one did, they promised they wouldn't (they lied) the same thing going for when they said they'd call back (they never did)

somehow I still managed to get the laptop, much later than planned, but! not without issue #1:

alongside the laptop contract of 499/month I was also signed up for a mobile sim card (on the 31st of May and the 31st of June, R139/month) I never asked for, no big deal, some small cash I had to part with that they would later refund me. the other problem is they debited my account for my actual contract of 499 a week early, on the 25th (I get paid at month end, and life is hard so there's no money in that account at that time) to which my bank charged me a late fee of R105. I will never get that money back as Telkom will take no responsibility for their wrongdoings)

To make sure I hold up my end of the bargain I made manual cash payments via checkers money market to keep my account up to date (over the two months Telkom debited the wrong dates, both time facing rejection fees now accumulating to a substantial amount) in spite of this Telkom debited my account to the value of R1201.20c on the 15th of August, far from any agreed debit order date as a means of obtaining their fees which I had already manually paid, therefore taking +- R2400 of my much needed money in total as opposed to the R1200 I had manually paid, when calling to inform them of their wrongdoings (many times, painfully) the agent was in agreement, after explaining to them when I'm supposed to be debited, that I have made manual payments, and showing them where Telkom has failed as a service provider (lets not forget the extra contract I didn't sign up for)

I assumed (silly me) that after those issues were brought to light that they would have sorted it out, no.

I was debited this month on the 15th to the value of R701.20c (why, I do not know) I phoned to enquire why, the agent proceeded to tell me that this was yet another mistake, as the collections department who has been debiting my account hasn't communicated with the regular debit order department in time, so this was a debit that unnecessarily came off and that I would not be debited for the coming month AND that I would receive a refund/discount on my next debit order to account for the extra R101,20c that came off, LOL. 

I have as of 08:05 this morning received an email from Telkom's Credit Management department that I OWE THEM R599.94c which is what has prompted me to file this complaint.

How is it that a contract taken out on the 1st of June has accumulated debt of R2500 (excluding the two wrongful extra debits of the extra contract I never signed, nor agreed to)  where I have made all necessary manual payments that should only even accumulate a debt of R2000 (499 over 4 months) even though all payments have been made? 

I also have all invoices, email chains, dispute queries (most without a response from Telkom) and even recorded phone calls saved to validate my unfortunate experience with Telkom. 

I have no idea what will come of this, regardless it needed to be written out and this was the best platform possible, I will copy this and distribute it to as many relevant parties until an actual living human being from Telkom contacts me as opposed to an automated, never responding system.

Its actually frustrating dealing with Telkom and not being able to complain or even speak to a Manger. I have been request call backs on numerous occasions and still nothing has transpired.

I made a payment on the 9th August using an old EFT reference linked to my OLD account. I then called the Telkom number 180 and was told I need to forward through my proof of payment to the ""Documents"" email address I did so and soon after received a reply from this mail server explaining that the mail box was full and the my mail was not received by the department. 
I then called the consultant back and explained what I had received and then was asked to forward the mail through and the consultant would then from their side escalate this to the documents department as well as a team leader. I received various reference numbers from these consultants as i had done this on a daily basis as the account was suspended. To date 27 September my account is suspended the payment was not allocated an consultant on the 14 September managed to get my account open for a few days just while investigations were under way but this still has not been resolved as the account once again had gone into suspended status. 

I am frustrated to the point where I want to finish this contract and never do business with them. Yet after each called I am forced to do a survey on the level of service received. The persons working with the results on this survey should've surely picked this up as well as I haven't been leaving any good feedback ???

The Service I'm receiving is way to shocking to know you are just a number and your query will not be attended to as they feel fit. Surely the 4-48 hours turn around time for the Payment allocations department has also expired from the 9th August. 

Begging and pleading from a call back from the Team Leader shouldn't be this difficult either. There should be someone higher in the organisation who would be able to assist me or even take the time to listen to my query ?

I'm preparing myself for an even bigger query where they will be deducting my monthly installment and arrears but haven't even allocated a payment from August 9th.

•	I have 4 mobile contracts at Telkom
•	In July this year I was persistently called by a Telkom consultant to upgrade my contract because the one I was on was no longer available. I made sure with the consultant that I would not be losing any of my benefits such as 100 free minutes which I pay for extra as well as the 2GB instant messaging including WhatsApp data. In fact the consultant confirmed that in fact I would still get that plus an extra 20GB of data per month for the next 3 months. THIS NEVER HAPPENED!
•	In fact, my 2GB was now reduced to 250MB, which is pathetic.
•	I called Telkom on 1 September regarding this issue and I was requested to send an email to online01… which I did - to date NO RESPONSE!
•	I called in this morning and again was pushed from pillow to post – first I spoke to Amanda Nosuzana at the retention centre, who was of NO HELP at all. Then my call was forwarded to customer service where I spoke to another lady who asked me to call 10213. Here I spoke to Sharon Dlamini who said she was putting me through to sales and then the call cut. Really???? I am so fed up. I was on the call for over an hour and no one was able to assist me. What am I supposed to do? Has service at Telkom gone down so badly? I had major surgery on 21 September and am off work for the next 6-8 weeks. I cannot drive otherwise I would have went to one of their local branches for assistance, but I have to rely on the phone. Why can Telkom not assist me or direct me to the correct department for help, is it too much to ask? Really pathetic service, all they care about is the money and NO CUSTOMER SERVICE OR CARE AT ALL!!!
