Incompetence & poor customer service  <p>i have been battling with Trudon for months. They keep billing me through Telkom for yellow pages which I never subscribed for. I tell them that the number belongs to an individual and I don't even know the company that they claim registered for YP. Each time the agent tells me that they have cancelled the subscription and il get a refund. But no refund comes and the amount being billed is increasing now!! This is just incompetence </p>,3

"Absolutely ridiculous! <p>I'm disgusted with the service! Firstly when I applied for my vehicle license, I was notified that the process will take 14 days. That's fine. On the 20th of May 2017 they told me that they couldn't renew it and I'd get my refund. Monday was my first enquiry as to when I'd get my refund and for two days my refund was promised to me. On Wednesday the 24th of May I was told that the turnover time is 5-6 days. Today I still haven't received a cent. I will be letting my company and friends know about this horrific experience. Will never use this service again!</p>",2

"Disgusting Service Worst cleaning service app ever. The worker herself, not even the company informs me few minutes before I expect a cleaner she will not make it. The company does not even have the decency to call the customer and let me know. I called them several times to find out what there issue was , they said the worker didn't inform them she won't make it. Secondly they took forever to find a replacement. Very very unreliable. I put my washing on and got ready for the cleaner not to pitch.",2
"Pathetic Telkom  <p>Since November2016 I have been batling with Telkom and their incapable workers! Every month their is extra charges on my account for services which I did not used. It keeps on ""escalating"" so much that my account is at their ""escalations"" department. Got home last night and guess what. Yes my line have been suspended not because I don't pay or don't want to pay but because their incapable workers don't do their work!</p>",2

"I really recommend IG products  I have been using IG for some time now. 2021 is my third year. I have this type of skin that easily dehydrates during winter no matter how long I try to stay indoors. My very first order didn't have any hydrating products and I was becoming worried, until the agent phoned to ask how the products are keeping my skin. I jumped to the opportunity to ask if there is something oily. Within few weeks I received a sample of Vitamin C and Hyaluronic. Yoh!! You can imagine how happy I was. My skin started to glow and I regained my confidence. 
I have now added Instaglam Primer and Instabalance Facial Elixir. You can feel the absorption while applying them to the skin. I love the fact that they are not greasy. The way they hydrate my skin makes me so satisfied. I will be turning 50 in September, but I hear a lot of my Facebook friends saying I look 30. We all enjoy aging, but no woman would want her age to show ?. IG gives a true meaning to the saying ""Aging Gracefully.""
I'm an IG addict
I'm beautiful 
I'm confident 
I'm forever young

"Incorrect debit order date I Have two contracts with Telkom Mobile, one will finish at the beginning of next year and the other had finished in November 2017. For the past 4 years, i have not come across a problem with billing, but this is one month I have. My debit order date in 25th of each month, this past billing went through on 24 November, but because they were insufficient funds in my account, it bounced back. I see the debit order did eventually go off on 30 November. I keep receiving messages that my account is overdue and when I had called the call centre, they advised that it was handed over to collections and that it will only reflect on their side in a couple working days and that I should not worry about it. However I have been charged a fee of R200 for that. For the past four years, the 25th fell on a Saturday a couple of times and would not have the sufficient funds and never experienced this problem before. My debit order is the 25th, you take the money on the 25th and no other day as per agreement. I will not pay the extra R200.",2

"Cancellation Fee <p>We installed a ADT alarm more than 10 years ago. Never misses an installment. We then sold the house in 2014. The people who bought the house didn't want the alarm. I phone them to tell them to disconnect the alarm as we sold the house. They told us that we must put it in writting which we did in Feb/March 2014. We reallocate to KZN and joined ADT again. In 2015 they phoned us and told us that we didn't cancelled the contract. We told them to look at their records because we did cancelled in writting and that we joined ADT in KZN. They said ok because we are still with ADT they will sort it out. In May 2016 we received a call and now we own the R3000,00 because of a cancellation Fee, We had the alarm at that specific address more than 12 years ago and they told us that if we cancelled within 3 years (36 months) that we will pay a cancellation fee.  The lady phoned again in June 2016 and told us that if we don't pay she will blacklist us. Never did we received and invoices or statements.</p>",2

"Telkom Rip off  Telkom currently has a special of 99 for 10 gig.
I went to telkom in Atteridgeville Nkomo Village, my 1st purchase was 99, but the consultant had an issue to give me my R1 change but eventually gave me in 10c coins. 
A week later I went again to buy 2, R99 10 gig vouchers. The consultant that was there was rude and refused to give me my R2 changed. He said that there is no 99 for 10 gig. I asked to speak to his manager and he said he is not there. He gave me a number but that number just rings it could be his friend for all that matters. He couldn't even give me a receipt they said their machine is offline, that they will email it to me that was 3 weeks ago and am still waiting.
Now the weird thing is that they only sell these vouchers as cash sales. No slips and charging customers 100. How many R1 are they pocketing. This is daylight robbery. Which should be sorted out asap ",2

"Amazing service <p>I was totally amazed by the staff of this Engen. I was driving home to Cape Town from Mossel Bay and like an idiot, I left my wallet where I was standing talking to some friends. Later on I received a phone call from my bank because the staff had taken the time to call my bank to report it so that they could contact me. I was already 100km away from Mossel Bay but I stopped and phoned Engen. The lady that answered knew exactly what I was talking about and told me that the supervisor had my wallet. When I finally got back to the Engen, I asked at the counter and was received with big smiles and friendly faces. The supervisor walked to the back office and returned with my entire wallet intact. My money, cards, drivers licence, id book and photos were all there. She even appologised for going through my wallet because she was trying to find a contact number. I didnt think there were such honest people left in the world. I was quite emotional and didnt even take the supervisor's name. THANK YOU so much for you honesty and friendly demeanor. You have saved me so much time and trouble in replacing everything in my wallet. I could never thank you enough!</p>",2

"FIX IT I am giving a 2 Star rating for the wonderful service I received from the consultant & the contract option that I'm on. The rest of the rating went towards the bad service received from thereafter.  Towards the end of June, beginning of July, I received a call from a female Mondo consultant , of whom I cannot recall the name, who offered me a beautiful Telkom contract that I was already considering at that time, but i told her that I was currently out of funds and would rather they call me towards the end of the following month. Instead, because she was really nice and insisted I take the package offered as it was on special & it might end, she said will speak to her leader in order to waiver the connection fee. I waited on the line for quite some time as she consulted with her boss. Her boss came to the line and confirmed and guaranteed me that in the next month, they will only be debiting R150.00 fixed amount that i will be paying for the rest of the contract with no extra costs whatsoever and the connection fee wavered, Because by then, I had already informed them that I'm not itting well financially. To get to the conclusion, I'm now sitting with a bill of  R681.95 on the second month merely because the 1st debit order bounced, as there was a request to debit R315.00... R200 activation fee, which I was advised I won't be paying for. I therefore cannot be paying for that and cannot account to the bank charges added onto the account due to a debit order bouncing off whereas there was sufficient money in my account, except that the money requested was higher than the money expected to be debited of which is not even my fault. FIX THIS!!!!!!!!!!!",2

"repairs <p>I booked in my phone for repair towards end of last year with cracked screen which is s4 and it was registered under ADH cover and they fixed my phone. Ever since it got back from repairs it started giving me problems it was freezing, deleting all the apps im downloading and kept on restarting. I went to telkom store and they did everything in their powers to help me until it started doing emegency calls only. I went back to the shop to book it in and im given a quotation of 4.8 thousand to fix the problem cause its no longer under the guarantee and they say the screen is damaged nd when i booked it in there was no cracked screen. How can they charge me 4.8 for network problem and that occurred after it came back from them? And its a technical problem not physical damege.</p>",2

"The Mattress Warehouse - horrible customer service. No Communication, No Delivery, No Honesty.

I'm not sure what's happening at the Midrand branch, but I would steer clear from ordering anything from Mattress Warehouse in the greater Gauteng area.

My Experience:
Ordered a mattress, the website looks legit, it proudly boasts fast delivery within major city areas, 5 days!, perfect.

A Week passes, no communications except an attempt to up sell a mattress protector. 
I request an ETA on delivery,,,, silence.
Two  days pass, I request another ETA,,,, silence.
Another day passes, I request cancellation of my order,,,, silence..
Another day passes, I phone, ooh terribly sorry, we don't have that, let me upgrade you... and deliver on the next day or the day after... YES, that will do, and at least I know that we have living breathing people at the company :).
15 minutes later, the phone rings, oh, we actually do have stock, you wont get the upgrade, but we will deliver by Friday.. I'm ok with this... it's December load shedding etc, let's be reasonable.
2 days pass, it's delivery day, I make provisions to be around to accept delivery, nothing happens.. I phone branch, oooooh it's not going to be delivered. 

Really... all you have to do is be honest, communicate and move mattress's ... why does it have to be a mission.

Anyway, I can go down the road, pay a little bit more and have a mattress delivered same day. 
Terrible service from the Mattress Warehouse.. what a shame.",2
