Eventually when I demanded that the manager come tell me this herself I was told by Dumisani that she said it is fine, we can come fetch the side panels when they have stock and Dumisani will phone me. One week later, website shows lots of stock but no call.. False advertising. So am I receiving a call from the manager in Montagu Gardens?? When am I getting my side panels??\")"
