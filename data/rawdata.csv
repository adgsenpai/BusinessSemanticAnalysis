So I have Telkom contract with Telkom for the last 4 Years, it was due for my second upgrade, Telkom kept on phoning for upgrade, so I finally decided to do it at the KILLARNEY Store, but unknowingly to know it is it the worst in terms of service.

I do the upgrade, only to notice a new line has been issued to me. Upgrade was for two contract, now sit with 4 numbers.

I tried to contact the store to sort out the issue, but to no luck, I had to drive down to the store to get the issue sorted for the number. upon request he sorted the issue after two days. But 2 days later Telkom sends me 2 invoices, amounting to R 1 787.00, Charging me for sim connection on an upgrade, there after billing for the other 2 numbers that were not even meant to be there.

I now contact the store again, to no Luck on the call. I had to drive down again to the store, but to find the person that helped was on leave. colleague said he will get the person to contact me the next day. 5 days later I still wait for the call. upon being frustrated with the issue, I call up the person the person that had told me, the colleague will call, then he hands over the phone to the consultant. 

Firstly he is rude, and not willing to accept the mistake he has made. He then goes on to tell me he does the upgrades differently from other stores, that means he overcharges all his upgrades. thereafter disputing the issues, he hangs up on me.

and now I sit with the bill that I'm not liable for. and at month end will be charged extra for upgrading with Telkom.

How best can we address this issue?

I stay in Parklands, Cape Town, Wester Cape

The  is the network is so poor such that I cant even make a call from my house, let alone the inability to use my mobile data. I solely rely in wifi to make whatsapp calls and when its off it means no calls for me. I need to drive up Parklands Main Road to Caltex Garage to be able to make a clear call.

This problem is common for me on Telkom and even MTN since my wife uses MTN.

I am on Andriod and I also have iOS.

I use Samsung A50 for Telkom Mobile, and iPhone 12 for MTN. This is not a devuce problem, it is a poor network issue in Parklands East, Surrey Street and Brompton Bend. Anyone that comes to our house cant make calls at all. So it is a common issue which might be linked to the lack of towers for the major networks such as MTN and Telkom.

in 2020 we moved from South Africa to the UAE, until recently I still had one contract with Telkom, and canceling this contract at the end of service proved to be an extremely difficult task, as no one I mailed or called replied or said that they weren’t able to assist with my cancelation.

I received a contact number of Piet Sherende at the Key West branch in Krugersdorp from my sister (they had a big issue with their home service a few months back and he was the only one able to assist them in a timely, friendly manner).

I proceeded to make contact with him and he immediately was able to tell me what documents he needed from me, he sent me the forms, and kept me posted on all progress.
Now, my line is finally canceled and I can only thank Piet for this.

He really went above and beyond with his service for me (and my sister), and he really was one of the most knowledgeable, friendly, and considerate employees of Telkom (or any large company for the matter!) I have ever had the pleasure of dealing with.

Would definitely recommend him and his team at Key West to all.",Telkom,telkom,best-telkom-employee-4220027,0,[],https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/hp-cdn-01/uploads/orgs/org_793962_logo_hPUx0SvDxJ768HorIPr8.png,/static/img/industries/icons/telecommunications-icon.jpg,Telecommunications,telecommunications,1,,WEBSITE,False,,2022-08-25,2,[]
