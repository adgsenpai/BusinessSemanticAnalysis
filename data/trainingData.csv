Untrustworthy business I was contacted if I wanted to upgrade a data contract that is on month to month which I did. In fact what they did was to add a second contract with the month to month still running. I requested the recording when I did the upgrade more than a week ago…and still they have not made it available. This business is the worst you can get. They are like vultures to get your business. Will never deal with them again.,0,1,50
"telkom Have been in a fight with TELKOM since August for a FRAUDULENT DEBIT ORDER that they have been taking off my account monthly. No matter how many mails, calls etc I make they carry on. I have a business manager by the name of EARL STRYDOM  tel number ********** who admits that it is fraud but promises to fix it, but doesn't. TELKOM owe us literally thousands for this FRAUD. STRYDOM is supposedly my business manager. Its because of people of this calibre that Telkom is in the mess its in. All I get are lies, promises and more lies! I cant afford legal action so what now????????????????
Is there ANYONE out there who can assist me?",0,1,1
"TELKOM Killarney Looting on Upgrade -10, 
So I have Telkom contract with Telkom for the last 4 Years, it was due for my second upgrade, Telkom kept on phoning for upgrade, so I finally decided to do it at the KILLARNEY Store, but unknowingly to know it is it the worst in terms of service.

I do the upgrade, only to notice a new line has been issued to me. Upgrade was for two contract, now sit with 4 numbers.

I tried to contact the store to sort out the issue, but to no luck, I had to drive down to the store to get the issue sorted for the number. upon request he sorted the issue after two days. But 2 days later Telkom sends me 2 invoices, amounting to R 1 787.00, Charging me for sim connection on an upgrade, there after billing for the other 2 numbers that were not even meant to be there.

I now contact the store again, to no Luck on the call. I had to drive down again to the store, but to find the person that helped was on leave. colleague said he will get the person to contact me the next day. 5 days later I still wait for the call. upon being frustrated with the issue, I call up the person the person that had told me, the colleague will call, then he hands over the phone to the consultant. 

Firstly he is rude, and not willing to accept the mistake he has made. He then goes on to tell me he does the upgrades differently from other stores, that means he overcharges all his upgrades. thereafter disputing the issues, he hangs up on me.

and now I sit with the bill that I'm not liable for. and at month end will be charged extra for upgrading with Telkom.

I need a solution @telkom",0,1,5
"TELKOM AND NUDEBT ARE ROGUES AND FRAUDSTERS!!! TELKOM ARE ROGUES. 
THEY STEAL OUR MONEY EVERY MONTH!!!
NOT MATTER HOW MUCH WE COMPLAIN NOTHING IS DONE ABOUT THEM.
NUDEBT IS A COMPANY CREATED BY AN ATTORNEY WHO ALSO STEALS!!!",0,1,20
"Despicable Service If I could give this company a 1 I would. The level of customer service and support is shocking. I’ve made my 5th call this month to this service provider with no resolution. My account gets debited twice, the first time with R800 extra and today the second time this month with R1100 extra. 
Called the supposed helpline (that’s helpless) and spoke to Lindane Dlamini and was told that he does not know where the payments come from and that I owe R5000 again!!!!!!!! How is this even possible if it was paid 31st October (doesn’t reflect on their end) 30th November and again today, WHAT IN THE ACTUAL HELL!!!!
No compassion, no care, no help at all",0,1,9
"CUSTOMER SERVICE IS DEAD It's been 3 days trying to get hold of Telkom through their 180, Twitter messages and also their feed with absolutely no success, all I'm met with is usually bots that basically does the same things I can do via USSD on my phone. I don't know who came up with this model and what happened to the customer service consultants but they have destroyed it for customers.",0,1,1

"Useless agent Telkom   your agents a really useless. Unfortunately I didn't get her name. On the 11th of Nov I logged a cancellation on an contract that expired in October but it's still working (don't know how) since I didn't get any confirmation regarding my cancellation I then decided to log it again on the portal, on the 24th of Nov. When I check this morning it has not been cancelled and new data was loaded. Called again and your agents told me that there was no cancellation logged on the 11th, only the Cancellation logged on the portal is reflecting. Reason for my cancellation is because I have already went with another ISP and I was avoiding being billed by two different ISPs",0,2,1
"Sim Card disconnected hour after complaint I have no other way of contacting Telkom and I am ****ed off. 

An hour after receiving my upgrade and calling because it's incorrect, my number is disconnected. I am completely disconnected!!!!!

Connect my sim card immediately!!!!!!!!!!",0,2,14
"Debit order deductions I usually have no problem with Telkom. Have been using them for years without complaint but in the last month the have deducted a debit order twice, to which I have to pay a banking fee, I paid the outstanding amount for the month and they charged me with another month which they have deducted 3 times, to which I also have to pay banking fees with every deduction. I have been trying to contact them without success. I have also tried to stop the debit order but it doesn't even show there is an debit order active from them. It is almost Christmas, I have presents to buy and a family to care for and I have nothing to show for it because they keep on deducting ignoring my numerous request for them to call me back and for trying to contact them.",0,2,1
"Black Friday with Telkom still in the black(dark) with the offer Good day,
I went into Telkom for a new phone contract and was told about the black Friday offer, being two phones A33 for R389. I was told I am approved, but I cannot get the package as they are waiting for stock of these phones. I am very disappointed because why? make an offer if you do not have stock. Is it perhaps a gimmick of some sorts. Black Friday was blue for me.",0,2,12
"Loyal Customer Been Taken For Ride I went in store to do a sim swop after I lost my phone. I was told that I am blacklisted and i cannot be assisted. I was told i need to pay a certain amount and i will be assisted. I was retrenched and i did let Telkom know and when i got the job i did the same again and started paying. What is worse is that my number is prepaid, so if this person that has my phone can do fraud with a cellphone number that is registered in my name what happens next. Please explain to me why i am blacklisted even though I am paying you monthly.",0,2,3
Signal very bad . Telkom need to review their network connection even voice calls are very inconvenient. There are many places that have no or limited coverage. For a national entity this is very bad .,0,2,4
"No coverage Telkom is good. The data bundles are super cheap. 
But for dear life I'm out of range. I'm convinced there's no place in South Africa where telkom works.",0,2,54
"Pathetic I can't help but wonder why every time I go into the Telkom store in Promenade, Mitchell's plain i get told the phone I want isn't in stock. Why do your people insist on lying and trying to sell me something they think I need? Luckily there was a guy kind enough to ask me which device I'm coming for and confirmed they had the device in stock. After being helped the agent lied to my face and told me they don't have it. After he approached us and asked why I changed my mind he told me the item is in stock. Only then I magically got the device I was coming for. This is disgusting and it needs to stop. Again this is not the first time the guys in telkom lied and told me the device I wanted wasn't in stock",0,2,6
"telkom contract Poor admin, took so many weeks to have my contact cancelled. Telkom continued to extend my contract and deducted monthly, despite my contract expiring.",0,2,3
"Telkom Let Down!!!! Its sad that in his digital age you find your self being forced to go out and enter a store rather than be able to do things online, So I was due for an upgrade on Telkom but due to a system error I was told I would have to go to a Telkom store with my proof of address, now why as a preexisting contract customer( been with Telkom for three years now)  I am sad how primitive Telkom is being by not allowing  me to email these documents they require and then processing my request",0,2,1

"BEST TELKOM EMPLOYEE I am writing this as one very happy (now ex-) customer of Telkom.

in 2020 we moved from South Africa to the UAE, until recently I still had one contract with Telkom, and canceling this contract at the end of service proved to be an extremely difficult task, as no one I mailed or called replied or said that they weren’t able to assist with my cancelation.

I received a contact number of Piet Sherende at the Key West branch in Krugersdorp from my sister (they had a big issue with their home service a few months back and he was the only one able to assist them in a timely, friendly manner).

I proceeded to make contact with him and he immediately was able to tell me what documents he needed from me, he sent me the forms, and kept me posted on all progress.
Now, my line is finally canceled and I can only thank Piet for this.

He really went above and beyond with his service for me (and my sister), and he really was one of the most knowledgeable, friendly, and considerate employees of Telkom (or any large company for the matter!) I have ever had the pleasure of dealing with.

Would definitely recommend him and his team at Key West to all.",1,5,2
"Good Service I was a customer at Telkom for 3 years, and I only had good service. Thanks",1,5,5
Telkom is a scam Telkom has not cancel my contract since i asked to cancel it.,1,5,2
Telkom Musgrave staff are friendly and helpful Thanks to Bongi @ the telkom Musgrave branch was connected after my phone was stolen on Saturday she was so helpful and service was great shoutout Bongi for everything you did for me helping me get a phone 📱 after such stressful thing happened.

"Agent of the year  Robyn Abdie at Telkom cust. serv. I would like to take my hat off for Robyn Abdie at Telkom cust. serv., she was super helpful in time of need unlike her other colleagues that I dealt with before her for the same query. I only needed a copy of my phone contract",1,5,3
"New Contract Yesterday I tried to get ahold of an agent, however the one I got was impatient and still waiting on her to return my call. I tried phoning again and spoke to Roxanne Pillay, super friendly and extremely clear, patient as my current phone struggled to answer the call when I needed her to phone me back. We need more people that does their jobs with pride and friendliness.
Thank you Roxanne🌻",1,5,6
"Great staff and products I have been with Telkom for years. Cheap with WiFi and Internet rates. Connection good.onky problems I found is billing issues, which I normally get resolved within 72hours because your ticket is logged and they return calls. The best is to go in store. My usual stores are Adderley Street Cape Town, which can become busy but very helpful and patient staff. The other store is Kenilworth Centre I had my last interactions where my matters were finalised immediately or latest 72hours with status updates from store instead of from myself having to follow up.",1,5,3
"Free Contract Sim Swap I lost my contract simcard and I did not want to go to get a new one not so fast anyways, i had hoped I would find it. But that nano simcard is so small once you lose it and unsure where, it is gone.

But I know the fellow networks charge a fee hence I didnt wanna rush cos I did not want to pay.

My husband encouraged me to go to the store and we requested for a new sim and a sim swap. And I asked "" how much will that be"". The guy at the counter answered ""Nothing, ma'am""   I was so suprised cos I had been charged more than R200 to replace a contract sim from a competitor network. 

But Telkom does it for free and its up and running same time . I just picked up where I left off. Thank you so much.",1,5,64
"Poor Connectivity and Network I stay in Parklands East in a free standing house in Surrey Street. Since residing here for the last 3-4 years ago the network has been very poor such that you cant real make a phone call with Telkom. You must rely on Whatsapp calls via the wifi.

I am certain that other home owners are also experiencing the same around the area. I wanted to check if MTN has sight of this issue from an infrastructure point of view? I dont think it makes sense for us to be living like this in a modern city as if we live in a farm somewhere in rural areas?

How best can we address this issue?

I stay in Parklands, Cape Town, Wester Cape

The  is the network is so poor such that I cant even make a call from my house, let alone the inability to use my mobile data. I solely rely in wifi to make whatsapp calls and when its off it means no calls for me. I need to drive up Parklands Main Road to Caltex Garage to be able to make a clear call.

This problem is common for me on Telkom and even MTN since my wife uses MTN.

I am on Andriod and I also have iOS.

I use Samsung A50 for Telkom Mobile, and iPhone 12 for MTN. This is not a devuce problem, it is a poor network issue in Parklands East, Surrey Street and Brompton Bend. Anyone that comes to our house cant make calls at all. So it is a common issue which might be linked to the lack of towers for the major networks such as MTN and Telkom.

Plz advise.",2,3,158
Always no stock. And bad service. Cheers Telkom. It has been good except for the bad service over the years. It is now the third time in a row when it comes to upgrade time that you do not have the phone I want available. Now it is time to leave. Maybe MTN can service me better.,2,3,45
"COMPLAINT I purchased a LTE data card for my modem ( plùg & play) on 8/11/2022. It has not picked up internet since..connection says ""connected without internet"".
I have phoned the customer care a total of 5 times, a manager has been meant to phone me on 2 occassions within 48hours,Im still waiting.
Im losing data without using the card at all & will lose it all on expiry date, yet no joy out of Telkom Customer Care AT ALL.",2,3,5
"In-store staff always call customer care A stage service at the store.

They seem to call the general customer care number when you walk in with any issue. It's pointless because you sit there with them watching them on the phone which you could do yourself at home. Makes no sense",2,3,8
"Add more security in their tower stations Telkom is making a great progress of implementing or installing network towers around the rural areas, and combine with other networks to increase better services around the areas but my worry is cruel people steal from that tower  were they take uninterrupted power supply so I urge for telkom to  increase more security and protect their equipments, because we appreciate their new developments",2,3,4
Telkom: Disappearing airtime Tried solving disappearing airtime problem. Advised to dial*179# to check for active subscriptions. None found. Never had any. No further feedback from 081180 Helpline. Still unresolved.,2,3,21
"Timely but issue sorted thanks Thank you for your assistance today. Even though when you walk in store they staff always call the general custom care line for absolutely any issue we may have which we can always do at home ourselves.

But anyways, issue sorted eventually. Thank you to Nombasa",2,3,12
"Stops working after 7pm Very good and affordable network. However, in some areas and after a certain time (usually 7pm), Telkom goes extremely slow and then tells you that you are out if data (even if you are not).",2,3,54
Account dispute Had an issue with my account. I cancelled the contract with Telkom however they did not terminate it and kept billing me. Tried for year to resolve it eventually all balance was reversed and account its on zero,2,3,5
"Hopeless I have Wifi contract with Telkom until May 2023. I am so unhappy with them. Every time loadshedding starts, Wifi lasts only about 45 minutes then it disappear until about 10min after loadshedding. I pay to have Wifi, but during loadshedding I have only 45min to can use Wifi. This is not right, I don't get what I pay for. There is also no way to can give them a call. I went to Telkom in a mall, and they not bothered, just said can't help me with the problem. All other providers don't have this problem, only Telkom, it does not make any sense, I want this problem sorted. I live in Stilbaai West. Not happy at all with Telkom very bad service.",2,3,1

"Bad service no response to email My insurance validators has sent all relevant information to get billing and beam reports for myself and my wife both Telkom numbers ********** and **********.

My claim is on hold for almost 8 weeks now because Telkom does not return their emails and don't respond to the request.

"Poor and Unfair service I have 3 mobile contracts with telkom 
I took or contact in the last 14 months 
And when I took contract and I signed insurance agreement.
I have now lost my device and when I put on a claim I was told I don't have a insurance. Went to branch (Northgate branch) and I was told that insurance was requested and signed for, however the consultant did not process it on a system and consultant is no longer working in a branch.

It's not my fault that consultant did not process he insurance requested and as much as I have more than 2 contracts how would I have known that one insurance is not active?

Now Telkom Mobile Northgate doesn't want to help,  instead they want me to pay 2400 9r take new contracts,  how is that fair?

I'm so inconvenienced,  struggling and so frustrated. 

Telkom mobile has failed me and treated me so unfairly 😭😭😭

"Problem fixed I experienced connectivity issues for a a couple of months and it was super frustrating! The agents were very helpful and patient, I must say.
